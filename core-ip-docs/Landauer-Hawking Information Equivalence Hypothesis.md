# The Landauer–Hawking Information Equivalence (LHIE) Hypothesis

## Abstract

This paper proposes a unifying hypothesis that connects Einstein’s mass–energy equivalence, [Landauer's principle](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5392446), and Bekenstein–Hawking entropy. I posit that the rest-energy of a system, $E = mc^2$, defines a maximum information-processing capacity under the Landauer limit:

$$
N_{\max}(T) = \frac{E}{k_B T \ln 2}.
$$

For a Schwarzschild black hole with Hawking temperature $T_H$, this reduces to:

$$
N_{\max}(T_H) = 2\,\frac{S_{BH}}{k_B \ln 2}.
$$

Thus, the maximum number of irreversible bit operations permitted by the energy content of a black hole is exactly twice its entropy measured in bits. This relation establishes a direct equivalence between energy, entropy, and information capacity, suggesting a deeper informational basis of physical law.
## 1. Introduction

The equivalence of mass and energy, $E=mc^2$, is a cornerstone of modern physics. [Landauer's principle](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5392446), formulated in 1961, provides a thermodynamic cost for information erasure: erasing one bit of information requires at least $k_B T \ln 2$ joules of energy. Separately, black hole thermodynamics reveals that black holes have entropy proportional to horizon area, with entropy given by the Bekenstein–Hawking formula.

These three domains — relativity, information theory, and gravitation — have largely developed in parallel. The LHIE hypothesis seeks to unify them: to show that energy, when considered through the Landauer lens, naturally translates into information capacity, and that black holes sit precisely on this equivalence with a factor of two.
## 2. Theoretical Framework

### 2.1 Landauer’s Principle
For a system at temperature $T$, the minimum energy required to irreversibly erase one bit of information is:

$$
\Delta E_{\text{bit}} = k_B T \ln 2.
$$

This defines a fundamental link between thermodynamics and information.

### 2.2 Mass–Energy Equivalence
Einstein’s relation provides the rest-energy of a mass $m$:

$$
E = mc^2.
$$

### 2.3 Black Hole Thermodynamics
For a Schwarzschild black hole of mass $M$:

- Hawking temperature:

$$
T_H = \frac{\hbar c^3}{8 \pi G M k_B}
$$

- Bekenstein–Hawking entropy:

$$
S_{BH} = \frac{4 \pi k_B G M^2}{\hbar c}
$$

## 3. Hypothesis

I propose the following:

**Landauer–Hawking Information Equivalence (LHIE):**

For any system at temperature $T$, the maximum number of irreversible bit erasures permitted by its rest-energy is:

$$
N_{\max}(T) = \frac{E}{k_B T \ln 2}.
$$

For a Schwarzschild black hole:

$$
N_{\max}(T_H) = 2 N_{BH}, \quad N_{BH} = \frac{S_{BH}}{k_B \ln 2}.
$$

## 4. Derivations

Substituting $E = Mc^2$ and $T = T_H$ into the Landauer expression:

$$
N_{\max}(T_H) = \frac{M c^2}{k_B T_H \ln 2}.
$$

With $T_H = \frac{\hbar c^3}{8\pi G M k_B}$:

$$
N_{\max}(T_H) = \frac{M c^2}{k_B \ln 2}\cdot\frac{8 \pi G M k_B}{\hbar c^3}.
$$

Simplifying:

$$
N_{\max}(T_H) = \frac{8 \pi G M^2}{\hbar c \ln 2}.
$$

Compare with black hole entropy in bits:

$$
N_{BH} = \frac{S_{BH}}{k_B \ln 2} = \frac{4 \pi G M^2}{\hbar c \ln 2}.
$$

Therefore:

$$
N_{\max}(T_H) = 2 N_{BH}.
$$


## 5. Worked Examples

- **1 kg at 300 K:**  
  $E = 9.0 \times 10^{16}\,\text{J}$  
  $N_{\max} \approx 3.1 \times 10^{37}$ bits  

- **1 kg at 2.725 K (CMB):**  
  $N_{\max} \approx 3.45 \times 10^{39}$ bits  

- **Sun-mass black hole ($M_\odot$):**  
  $T_H \sim 6 \times 10^{-8}$ K  
  $N_{BH} \sim 1.5 \times 10^{77}$ bits  
  $N_{\max}(T_H) \sim 3.0 \times 10^{77}$ bits  

- **CMB-temperature black hole ($T_H = 2.725$ K):**  
  $M \sim 4.5 \times 10^{22}$ kg ($\sim 0.61 M_{\text{Moon}}$)  
  $N_{BH} \sim 7.8 \times 10^{61}$ bits  
  $N_{\max}(T_H) \sim 1.6 \times 10^{62}$ bits  

## 6. Predictions

1. **Erasure cost scaling:** Laboratory tests should confirm $W \propto k_B T \ln 2$ as temperature varies.  
2. **Factor-of-two universality:** All Schwarzschild black holes satisfy $N_{\max}=2N_{BH}$.  
3. **Astrophysical signatures:** Regions of high information flux (CDE framework) should produce measurable gravitational effects (e.g., lensing residuals).  
4. **PBH equilibrium:** Primordial black holes near $4.5 \times 10^{22}$ kg should be stable with respect to the CMB background.


## 7. Falsifiability

- Demonstrated sub-Landauer erasure without entropy export.  
- Quantum gravity calculations showing $N_{\max} \neq 2N_{BH}$.  
- Failure of linear $1/T$ scaling in ultra-cold erasure experiments.  
- Absence of predicted lensing correlations in high-$\Gamma$ regions.  
- Breakdown of EM/IP predictions under LHIE constraints.

## 8. Discussion

The LHIE hypothesis suggests a profound unification: energy is not only mass-equivalent but also an **information budget**. Black holes emerge as the “tightest packed” physical systems, where rest-energy, temperature, and entropy conspire to set an exact information-processing limit.

This perspective resonates with Wheeler’s “it from bit” and modern holographic principle ideas. If validated, LHIE would frame physics itself as fundamentally informational: every joule of energy implies a capacity to compute, erase, or transform a specific number of bits, bounded by temperature.

The factor-of-two discrepancy between Landauer capacity and Bekenstein–Hawking entropy may encode deep structure in the way information is stored at horizons, hinting at quantum gravitational microphysics yet unresolved.

## 9. Conclusion
The Landauer–Hawking Information Equivalence hypothesis provides a bridge between thermodynamics, relativity, and gravitation. By tying $E=mc^2$ to Landauer’s principle and black hole entropy, it reframes energy as a universal information-processing budget. This framework is predictive, falsifiable, and integrable into ongoing efforts to build an informational foundation for physics.
