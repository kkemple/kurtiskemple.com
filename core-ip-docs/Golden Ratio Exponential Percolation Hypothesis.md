## Core Discovery

Percolation thresholds across dimensions follow golden ratio powers with exponential scaling, positioned consistently at 66% within dimension-specific connectivity ranges.

## Mathematical Framework

### Exponential Golden Ratio Scaling

The theoretical threshold for dimension d follows:

$$p_{golden}(d) = \varphi^{-2^{(d-2)}}$$

Where φ = (1 + √5)/2 ≈ 1.618

#### Dimensional Progression

| Dimension | Power | Golden Threshold | Calculation |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|-------------|
| 2D | -2^0 = -1 | φ^-1 ≈ 0.618 | 1/1.618 |
| 3D | -2^1 = -2 | φ^-2 ≈ 0.382 | 1/2.618 |
| 4D | -2^2 = -4 | φ^-4 ≈ 0.146 | 1/6.854 |

Note: The exponential doubling (skipping φ^-3) suggests connectivity requirements decrease exponentially with dimension, not linearly.

## Dimensional Ranges and 66% Positioning

### Universal Pattern

Golden ratio values consistently sit at 66% position within each dimension's operational range:

$$p_{golden} = p_{min} + 0.66 \times (p_{max} - p_{min})$$

### Dimension-Specific Ranges

#### 2D (Quantum Systems)

- **Range:** 0.50 to 0.68
- **Golden position:** φ^-1 = 0.618 at 66%
- **Verification:** 0.50 + 0.66 × (0.68 - 0.50) = 0.619 ✓
- **Observed:** 0.67 (97% position, near maximum)

#### 3D (Mesoscale Systems)

- **Range:** 0.25 to 0.45
- **Golden position:** φ^-2 = 0.382 at 66%
- **Verification:** 0.25 + 0.66 × (0.45 - 0.25) = 0.382 ✓
- **Observed:** 0.45 (100% position, at maximum)

#### 4D (Cosmic Systems)

- **Range:** 0 to 0.221
- **Golden position:** φ^-4 = 0.146 at 66%
- **Verification:** 0 + 0.66 × (0.221 - 0) = 0.146 ✓
- **Observed:** 0.09 (41% position, below golden)

## System Operating Positions

### Relative to Golden Markers

Systems operate at different positions relative to their golden ratio markers:

| System    | Dimension | Golden Value | Observed | Position            | Operating Regime |
| --------- | --------- | ------------ | -------- | ------------------- | ---------------- |
| Quantum   | 2D        | 0.618        | 0.67     | Above golden (97%)  | Near critical    |
| Mesoscale | 3D        | 0.382        | 0.45     | Above golden (100%) | At critical      |
| Cosmic    | 4D        | 0.146        | 0.09     | Below golden (41%)  | Subcritical      |

### Interpretation

- **Quantum systems:** Push toward maximum connectivity for information processing
- **Mesoscale systems:** Operate at upper boundary for optimal balance
- **Cosmic systems:** Maintain sparse connectivity to preserve structure

## Pyramid Structure Mapping

The dimensional hierarchy forms a pyramid with increasing connectivity density as dimensions decrease:

```
      2D: p=0.67 (Dense)
         /    \
        /      \
    3D: p=0.45 (Balanced)
      /          \
     /            \
4D: p=0.09 (Sparse)
```

### Information Conservation

Testing the conservation principle across dimensions:

| Dimension | Connectivity | Scale (m) | D × p × log(scale) |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|-------------------|
| 2D | 0.67 | 10^-9 | -13.8 |
| 3D | 0.45 | 10^0 | 0 |
| 4D | 0.09 | 10^7 | 2.52 |

The pattern doesn't show simple conservation, suggesting additional factors or non-linear relationships.

## Implications for CDE-EVL Model

### Percolation Threshold Updates

Replace fixed thresholds with golden ratio-based values:

```python
def golden_threshold(d):
    """Calculate golden ratio threshold for dimension d"""
    power = -(2**(d-2))
    return PHI**power

def connectivity_range(d):
    """Define operational range for dimension d"""
    if d == 2:
        return (0.50, 0.68)
    elif d == 3:
        return (0.25, 0.45)
    elif d == 4:
        return (0.0, 0.221)
```

### Modified Percolation Function

```python
def percolation_position(p_observed, d):
    """Calculate position within dimensional range"""
    p_min, p_max = connectivity_range(d)
    position = (p_observed - p_min) / (p_max - p_min)
    golden = golden_threshold(d)
    golden_pos = (golden - p_min) / (p_max - p_min)

    return {
        'observed_position': position,
        'golden_position': golden_pos,
        'relative_to_golden': position / golden_pos
    }
```

## Testable Predictions

### 1. Dimensional Transitions

Systems transitioning between dimensions should pass through golden ratio values at 66% position in their operational range.

### 2. Optimization Points

Maximum efficiency should occur when systems operate at their dimensional golden ratio value.

### 3. 5D Extension

If pattern continues, 5D systems would have:

- Golden threshold: φ^-8 ≈ 0.0213
- Operating range: 0 to ~0.032 (if golden at 66%)

### 4. Prime Scale Interaction

The prime number scales (0.5, 1, 5, 35 Mly) might represent resonance-free positions within these golden ratio ranges.

## Voxel Lattice Computational Constraints

### Connection to Speed of Light Limit

The exponential scaling φ^(-2^(d-2)) relates directly to information propagation through the voxel lattice where c = ℓ_v/τ_v. Higher dimensions require evaluating exponentially more adjacent voxels per hop:

#### Adjacent Voxel Scaling

| Dimension | Direct Neighbors | With Diagonals | Evaluation Complexity |
|-----------|-----------------|----------------|----------------------|
| 2D | 4 | 8 | O(2^2) |
| 3D | 6 | 26 | O(2^3) |
| 4D | 8 | 80 | O(2^4) |

Each hop time τ_v must accommodate evaluation of all adjacent voxels to determine optimal information propagation path. The exponential increase in neighbors explains why connectivity must decrease exponentially to maintain the speed of light constraint.

### Computational Cost Trade-off

The golden ratio scaling φ^(-2^(d-2)) represents the optimal balance between:

- **Connectivity:** Higher enables more information flow
- **Computational feasibility:** Lower reduces voxel evaluations per hop

Example calculation for maintaining constant information processing rate:

- 2D at 67% connectivity: ~5 active connections per voxel
- 4D at 67% connectivity: ~54 active connections per voxel (unsustainable)
- 4D at 9% connectivity: ~7 active connections per voxel (sustainable)

### Why Cosmic Systems Operate Below Golden Position

The cosmic scale operates at 0.09 (41% of range) rather than at φ^-4 = 0.146 (66% position) because:

1. **Speed of light constraint:** Maintaining 14.6% connectivity in 4D spacetime would require evaluation time exceeding τ_v
2. **Causal structure preservation:** Higher connectivity could create closed timelike curves
3. **Information processing limit:** The system sacrifices connectivity to maintain c as universal speed limit

This explains why dimensional systems show different positions relative to golden markers:

- **2D quantum:** Can afford near-maximum connectivity (low evaluation cost)
- **3D mesoscale:** Operates at maximum sustainable connectivity
- **4D cosmic:** Must operate below golden ratio to respect c = ℓ_v/τ_v constraint

## Prime Structure Spacing for Hop Optimization

### Complementary Optimization Strategies

While golden ratio scaling optimizes connectivity within dimensions, prime number spacing optimizes spatial distribution for information flow:

1. **Golden ratio:** Optimizes connectivity density (how many connections)
2. **Prime spacing:** Optimizes path efficiency (how information travels)

### Minimal Hop Principle

Information traversing a lattice with hop constraint c = ℓ_v/τ_v requires minimal path redundancy. Prime-separated structures ensure:

#### Complete Coverage Without Redundancy

- Prime steps visit every voxel exactly once before repeating
- No wasted hops on redundant paths
- Maximum information transfer per hop cycle

#### Resonance Avoidance

- Composite separations create multiple equivalent paths
- Prime separations force unique routing
- No standing waves that lock information

### Cosmic Structure Scale Analysis

Observed scales (0.5, 1, 5, 35 Mly) approximate ratios of small primes:

| Structure | Scale (Mly) | Ratio | Prime Factors |
|-----------|-------------|-------|---------------|
| Proto-galaxy | 0.5 | 1 | 1 |
| Galaxy | 1.0 | 2 | 2 |
| Group | 5.0 | 10 | 2×5 |
| Cluster | 35.0 | 70 | 2×5×7 |

These ratios minimize hop overlap while maintaining harmonic relationships that enable hierarchical organization.

### Information Flow Efficiency

For limited hops per unit time (c = ℓ_v/τ_v):

$\text{Efficiency} = \frac{\text{Unique paths}}{\text{Total hops}} = \frac{\text{gcd}(L_1, L_2)}{L_1 \times L_2}$

Prime separations maximize this efficiency by minimizing gcd(L₁, L₂).

### Selection Mechanism

The collision-diffusion process naturally selects for prime-spaced structures:

1. Non-prime spacings create resonant interference
2. Resonance wastes limited hop budget
3. Inefficient structures get selected against
4. Prime spacings persist and amplify

This explains why CDE-EVL naturally produces these scales - they represent information flow optima within voxel constraints.

## 1) Structural law (dimension-only; exact)

**Golden percolation threshold by dimension**

$$
p_{\text{golden}}(d)=\varphi^{-2^{(d-2)}},\qquad \varphi=\tfrac{1+\sqrt5}{2}\approx1.618
$$

**Values**

- 2D: $\varphi^{-1}=0.618$
- 3D: $\varphi^{-2}=0.382$
- 4D: $\varphi^{-4}=0.1459$
- 5D: $\varphi^{-8}=0.021286$

**Self-similarity (fractal invariance)**

$$
\frac{p_{\text{golden}}(d+1)}{p_{\text{golden}}(d)}=p_{\text{golden}}(d)
$$

This is the invariant. It’s not additive or product conservation; it’s **structural** (ratio) invariance.

## 2) Range rule (empirical; matches your tables)

Golden sits at **66%** of each dimension’s operational range:

$$
p_{\text{golden}}=p_{\min}+0.66\,(p_{\max}-p_{\min})
$$

Examples (your ranges):

- 2D: $[0.50,\,0.68]\Rightarrow 0.50+0.66(0.18)=0.619\approx 0.618$
- 3D: $[0.25,\,0.45]\Rightarrow 0.25+0.66(0.20)=0.382$
- 4D: $[0,\,0.221]\Rightarrow 0.66(0.221)=0.146$
- 5D (derived): $p_{\min}=0 \Rightarrow p_{\max}=\tfrac{p_{\text{golden}}}{0.66}=0.032252$

## 3) Operational law (constraint-based; explains deviations)

Observed operating connectivity $p_{\text{op}}(d)$ is **clipped** by an **active-neighbor budget**. Using hypercubic neighborhoods with diagonals ($N(D)=3^D-1$), and a roughly constant active set $k\approx 7$ (calibrated by 4D):

$$
p_{\text{op}}(d)\;\approx\;\min\!\Big(p_{\max}(d),\;\frac{k}{3^d-1}\Big)
$$

**Checks**

- 4D: $k/(3^4-1)=7/80=0.0875\approx 0.09$ (your observed) → **sub-golden**.
- 5D: $k/(3^5-1)=7/242=0.0289$. With $[0,\,0.032252]$, position $=0.0289/0.032252=0.897$ → **above golden** (≈90% of range).
- 2D/3D sit near max (2D ≈ 0.67, 3D = 0.45), consistent with low neighbor burden.

**Interpretation**

- **Golden thresholds (φ-powers)** set where the “sweet spot” sits **in principle**.
- **Operating points** shift because high-D lattices explode neighbor evaluation cost; to preserve $c=\ell_v/\tau_v$ and causal structure, systems adopt a **constant-k** budget → **constraint-based scaling**.

## 4) What this unifies (with your numbers)

- **2D (quantum):** near max (0.67), **above** golden—cheap neighborhood ⇒ can run hot.
- **3D (mesoscale):** at max (0.45), **on/above** golden—balanced.
- **4D (cosmic):** 0.09 (41% of range), **below** golden—throttled by causality / hop evaluation.
- **5D (forecast):** ≈0.0289 (≈90% of range), **above** golden but **tiny absolute p**—range collapses with $d$.

## 5) Plug back into CDE–EVL (drop-in rules)

**Golden schedule (structure):**

$$
p_{\text{golden}}(d)=\varphi^{-2^{(d-2)}},\quad
p_{\max}(d)=\frac{p_{\text{golden}}(d)-p_{\min}(d)}{0.66}+p_{\min}(d)
$$

**Operational clip (constraint):**

$$
p_{\text{op}}(d)=\min\!\Big(p_{\max}(d),\,\frac{k}{3^d-1}\Big),\ \ k\approx7
$$

This reproduces 4D≈0.09, predicts 5D≈0.0289, preserves the φ-structure, and keeps $c=\ell_v/\tau_v$ safe.

## 6) Falsifiable predictions

1. **5D percolation** (simulation): hypercubic with diagonals, measure critical bands. Expect golden $= \varphi^{-8}\approx0.021286$ at **66%** of the empirically recovered range; operating point near $0.0289$ if **constant-k** holds.
2. **Active neighbors**: across 3D→4D data (biological tissues, porous flow, cosmic network toy models) the **effective active degree** clusters near a constant $k\approx 7\pm 2$.
3. **Range compression with $d$**: $p_{\max}(d)$ shrinks roughly in line with $\varphi^{-2^{(d-2)}}/0.66$.
4. **Quasi-invariant $D\,p$**: holds 2D↔3D (≈1.34–1.35), **fails** by 4D (≈0.36) exactly where the neighbor-burden clip bites.
5. **Cross-domain positioning**: quantum systems above golden; mesoscale at max; cosmic sub-golden; 5D simulated networks above golden but with negligible absolute $p$.

## 7) Bottom line

- **Yes**: $p_{\text{golden}}(d)=\varphi^{-2^{(d-2)}}$ holds as the **structural** (fractal) law; golden sits at **66%** of each dimension’s range.
- **And**: real systems don’t sit exactly at $p_{\text{golden}}$ because they’re **constraint-limited** by an **active-neighbor budget**—captured by $p\approx k/(3^d-1)$.
- The combination explains **why** 2D runs hot, 3D runs balanced, 4D is throttled, and gives a **numerical 5D forecast** that can be tested immediately in simulation.
