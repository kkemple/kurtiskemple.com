# Gravitational Waves Through the EVL Framework: Scale-Invariant Collision-Diffusion Dynamics

## Abstract

We present a theoretical framework demonstrating that gravitational wave events and the Big Bang can be described by the same collision-diffusion equation (CDE), revealing a scale-invariant mechanism for information topology transformations across 22 orders of magnitude. Within the Electromagnetic Voxel Lattice (EVL) framework, both cosmic birth and black hole mergers represent catastrophic reorganizations of incompatible information boundaries, with gravitational waves encoding the thermodynamic cost of these transformations according to Landauer's principle. This framework makes specific, falsifiable predictions about gravitational wave propagation, polarization states, and correlations with electromagnetic phenomena that differ from general relativity while remaining consistent with current observations.

## 1. Introduction

The detection of gravitational waves has opened a new window into the universe's most violent events. Within the EVL framework, these waves represent propagating patterns of information processing through a discrete spacetime substrate composed of electromagnetic voxels. The remarkable discovery presented here is that the same mathematical structure describing cosmic birth through boundary collision also governs black hole mergers, suggesting a universal mechanism for information topology transformation.

The scale invariance spans:

- **Spatial scales:** From Schwarzschild radii (~10⁴ m) to the Hubble radius (~10²⁶ m)
- **Temporal scales:** From merger timescales (~10⁻⁴ s) to the Hubble time (~10¹⁷ s)
- **Energy scales:** From stellar mass mergers (~10⁴⁷ J) to cosmic birth (~10⁶⁹ J)

This 22-order-of-magnitude invariance across all three dimensions suggests that information topology transformations follow universal mathematical principles independent of scale.

## 2. Mathematical Framework

### 2.1 Fundamental Equations

The collision-diffusion equation governs both cosmic and merger events:

$$\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t} = D(r,t)\nabla^2 \phi - R_{\text{info}}(r,t)$$

For cosmic birth (CDE-cosmic):
$$R_{\text{info}}^{\text{cosmic}}(z) = \beta_0\left(\frac{1+z}{1+z_c}\right)^q \exp\left[-\frac{(z-z_c)^2}{2w^2}\right]$$

For black hole mergers (CDE-merger):
$$R_{\text{info}}^{\text{merger}}(r,t) = \beta_{BH} \left(\frac{r_s}{r}\right)^q \exp\left[-\frac{(t-t_{\text{merger}})^2}{2\tau_{\text{ring}}^2}\right]$$

The mathematical structure is identical: a power law modulated by a Gaussian peak, with spatial dependence replacing redshift for local events.

### 2.2 Information Processing in the Voxel Lattice

Gravitational waves propagate through discrete voxel hops at the fundamental rate:

$$c = \frac{\ell_v}{\tau_v}$$

where $\ell_v = \ell_P = 1.616 \times 10^{-35}$ m and $\tau_v = t_P = 5.391 \times 10^{-44}$ s.

The strain measured by detectors represents fractional changes in voxel connectivity:

$$h = \frac{\Delta L}{L} = \frac{\ell_v}{\lambda_{GW}} \cdot \frac{\nabla \phi}{\phi_0}$$

### 2.3 Thermodynamic Cost of Topology Transformation

The energy carried by gravitational waves equals the Landauer cost of information reorganization:

$$E_{GW} = k_B T_{\text{eff}} \ln(2) \times N_{\text{bits}}$$

For a merger releasing $\Delta M c^2$ in gravitational waves:

$$N_{\text{bits}} = \frac{\Delta M c^2}{k_B T_{\text{eff}} \ln 2}$$

Using the Hawking temperature for the effective temperature provides a direct connection between black hole thermodynamics and information processing.

### 2.4 Percolation Threshold and Merger Dynamics

The merger occurs when voxel connectivity reaches the critical percolation threshold:

$$p(r,t) \to p_c = 0.45$$

Below this threshold, the two information boundaries remain distinct. Above it, catastrophic reorganization becomes inevitable. This explains the universal behavior observed in numerical relativity simulations - they capture a critical phase transition that always occurs at the same threshold.

## 3. Observable Predictions

### 3.1 Frequency-Dependent Dispersion

The discrete lattice structure predicts velocity dispersion for gravitational waves:

$$v_g(\omega) = c\left(1 - \alpha\left(\frac{\omega \ell_v}{c}\right)^2\right)$$

**Prediction:** High-frequency components arrive slightly later than low-frequency components from cosmological distances.

**Observable test:** For a neutron star merger at z = 0.1 with peak frequency 2 kHz:

- Time delay: $\Delta t \approx 10^{-5}$ seconds between 2 kHz and 500 Hz components
- Required timing precision: microsecond-level correlation between detectors
- Best targets: High-frequency neutron star mergers at z > 0.5

### 3.2 Modified Quasinormal Mode Frequencies

The ringdown frequencies receive corrections from discrete lattice effects:

$$f_n^{\text{EVL}} = f_n^{\text{GR}}\left(1 - \epsilon\left(\frac{\ell_v}{r_s}\right)^2\right)$$

**Prediction:** Systematic deviation from GR predictions scaling with black hole mass.

**Observable test:**

- For 10 M☉ black hole: ~10⁻⁶⁰ fractional deviation (undetectable)
- For primordial black holes ~10⁻⁵ M☉: ~10⁻⁵⁰ fractional deviation
- Cumulative effect over many events might reveal systematic bias

### 3.3 Additional Polarization Modes

The discrete lattice could support scalar and vector modes beyond GR's tensor modes:

$$h_{ij} = h_+ e^+_{ij} + h_\times e^\times_{ij} + h_b e^b_{ij} + h_L e^L_{ij}$$

**Prediction:** Breathing and longitudinal modes at amplitudes ~$(ℓ_v/\lambda_{GW})^2$ relative to tensor modes.

**Observable test:**

- Network of 5+ detectors required to separate polarizations
- Most sensitive to edge-on binary orientations
- Expected amplitude: ~10⁻⁴⁰ for current detectors (below noise floor)

### 3.4 Chromatic Gravitational Lensing

Different gravitational wave frequencies experience different deflection angles:

$$\alpha(\lambda) = \alpha_0\left(1 + \frac{\lambda}{\lambda_c}\right)^{-1/2}$$

where $\lambda_c \sim \sqrt{D(z)/R_{\text{info}}(z)}$ from the CDE.

**Prediction:** Frequency-dependent arrival times for lensed gravitational waves.

**Observable test:**

- Strong lensing of GW by galaxy cluster
- Time delay between 100 Hz and 1000 Hz components: ~milliseconds
- Requires detection of strongly lensed GW (expected rate: ~1 per year with next-generation detectors)

### 3.5 Information Processing Correlations

Enhanced electromagnetic activity should correlate with gravitational wave events due to increased $R_{\text{info}}$:

$$R_{\text{info}}^{\text{induced}}(r,t) \propto \frac{E_{GW}}{4\pi r^2 c t} \exp\left(-\frac{t}{\tau_{\text{diff}}}\right)$$

**Prediction:** Delayed electromagnetic brightening in regions surrounding GW events.

**Observable test:**

- Monitor AGN activity within 100 Mpc of GW events
- Expected delay: days to weeks after GW detection
- Enhancement: ~1% increase in accretion rate

## 4. Falsifiable Criteria

The framework makes several predictions that, if not observed, would falsify the theory:

### 4.1 Critical Falsification Tests

1. **No frequency dispersion:** If gravitational waves show zero dispersion to precision of $10^{-20}$ across all frequencies
2. **Perfect GR ringdown:** If quasinormal modes match GR to precision of $10^{-15}$ with no systematic bias
3. **No additional polarizations:** If polarization content matches pure GR tensor modes to $10^{-10}$ precision
4. **No lensing chromaticity:** If all frequencies deflect identically to $10^{-15}$ precision
5. **No EM correlations:** If no systematic electromagnetic enhancements follow GW events

### 4.2 Consistency Requirements

The theory requires:

- Scale invariance of CDE across 22 orders of magnitude
- Percolation threshold $p_c = 0.45$ for all merger events
- Information conservation through topology transformations
- Landauer energy-information relationship holds at all scales

Violation of any consistency requirement would require fundamental revision of the framework.

## 6. Connection to Broader Framework

### 6.1 Unification Through Scale Invariance

The discovery that cosmic birth and black hole mergers follow identical mathematics suggests profound unification:

| Event Type | Spatial Scale | Time Scale | Energy Scale | CDE Parameter |
|------------|---------------|------------|--------------|---------------|
| Big Bang | 10²⁶ m | 10¹⁷ s | 10⁶⁹ J | $R_{\text{info}}(z)$ |
| Galaxy Collision | 10²¹ m | 10¹⁵ s | 10⁵⁸ J | Intermediate |
| Star Formation | 10¹⁴ m | 10¹³ s | 10⁴⁴ J | Intermediate |
| BH Merger | 10⁴ m | 10⁻⁴ s | 10⁴⁷ J | $R_{\text{info}}(r,t)$ |
| Particle Collision | 10⁻¹⁵ m | 10⁻²³ s | 10⁻⁹ J | Quantum limit |

The same collision-diffusion dynamics span 41 orders of magnitude in space and 40 in time.

### 6.2 Information Conservation Principle

All events conserve total boundary information while requiring thermodynamic payment for topology transformations:

$$\sum_i B_i = B_{\text{total}} = \text{constant}$$

$$E_{\text{transform}} = k_B T \ln(2) \sum_i N_{\text{bits},i} \times \eta_{\text{topology},i}$$

This principle connects quantum information theory, black hole thermodynamics, and cosmological evolution.

## 7. Implications for Physics

### 7.1 Gravity as Information Processing

Gravitational waves represent the universe's method of propagating information about topology transformations. The waves carry not just energy but the computational history of the merger event - the bit-by-bit reorganization frozen into the waveform.

### 7.2 Quantum Gravity Connection

The discrete voxel lattice naturally implements a quantum theory of gravity where:

- Spacetime has minimum meaningful units
- Information processing generates curvature
- Topology changes require thermodynamic payment

### 7.3 Cosmological Consequences

If the Big Bang and black hole mergers follow the same dynamics, then:

- The universe began as a collision between incompatible information topologies
- Dark energy represents ongoing information reorganization
- Structure formation follows percolation physics in the voxel lattice

## 8. Conclusion

The observation that gravitational wave events and cosmic birth follow identical collision-diffusion dynamics across 22 orders of magnitude suggests a fundamental principle: information topology transformations are scale-invariant processes governed by universal mathematical structures. This framework makes specific, testable predictions that distinguish it from general relativity while maintaining consistency with current observations.

The next decade of gravitational wave astronomy will provide crucial tests. Detection of frequency dispersion, polarization anomalies, or systematic deviations from GR in ringdown frequencies would support the EVL framework. Conversely, perfect agreement with continuous spacetime predictions would challenge the discrete lattice model.

The profound implication is that gravitational waves may be telling us not just about merging black holes, but about the fundamental information-theoretic nature of spacetime itself - a discrete electromagnetic substrate where gravity emerges from the universe's computation of its own evolution.
