## Abstract

Transformation space thermodynamics predicts that evaporating primordial black holes exhibit unique information processing signatures distinguishable from stellar-collapse gamma-ray bursts. As black hole mass decreases, Hawking temperature rises, expanding accessible transformation dimensions while maintaining near-zero positional energy multiplier. This creates a runaway information processing cascade in the final moments before evaporation, producing characteristic electromagnetic signatures that should be detectable by current and next-generation gamma-ray observatories.

## 1. Theoretical Framework

### 1.1 Hawking Temperature Evolution

The Hawking temperature of an evaporating black hole scales inversely with mass:

$$T_H = \frac{\hbar c^3}{8\pi G M k_B} = \frac{1.227 \times 10^{23} \text{ K}}{M/\text{kg}}$$

As the black hole evaporates, its temperature rises, accelerating the evaporation:

$$\frac{dM}{dt} = -\frac{\hbar c^4}{15360\pi G^2 M^2} = -\frac{2.8 \times 10^{-8} \text{ kg}^3/\text{s}}{M^2}$$

### 1.2 Transformation Space Dynamics

The effective operational temperature for a black hole is:

$$T_{\text{eff}} = \frac{T_H}{1 + \eta_{BH}}$$

For stellar-mass black holes, $\eta_{BH} \approx 10^{-32}$ (essentially zero waste), so:

$$T_{\text{eff}} \approx T_H$$

### 1.3 Dimensional Accessibility During Evaporation

As $T_H$ rises during evaporation, dimensional accessibility follows Boltzmann distribution:

$$P_i = \frac{e^{-E_i/k_B T_H}}{\sum_j e^{-E_j/k_B T_H}}$$

Critical temperatures for dimensional access:
- Past dimension: $T > 10^{20}$ K (always accessible during final phase)
- Internal dimension: $T > 10^{21}$ K (accessible when $M < 10^{12}$ kg)
- External dimension: $T > 10^{22}$ K (accessible when $M < 10^{11}$ kg)
- Future dimension: $T > 10^{23}$ K (accessible when $M < 10^{10}$ kg)

### 1.4 SEC Evolution During Evaporation

The System Entropy Change capacity evolves as:

$$\mathrm{SEC}_{BH}(t) = \frac{6 \cdot \mathbf{V}}{1 + \eta_{BH}(t)} \times A_{\text{transform}}(T_H)$$

Where transformation area expands with temperature:

$$A_{\text{transform}} = \pi \times \left(\frac{T_H}{T_{\text{Planck}}}\right)^{1/2}$$

## 2. Unique Evaporation Signatures

### 2.1 Three-Phase Evolution

**Phase 1: Thermal Rise** ($M > 10^{12}$ kg, $t < t_{\text{final}} - 1$ year)
- Slow temperature increase
- Two dimensions accessible (Past, Internal)
- Steady gamma-ray emission
- Power law spectrum: $F_\nu \propto \nu^{-\alpha}$ with $\alpha \approx 1.5$

**Phase 2: Dimensional Cascade** ($10^{10} < M < 10^{12}$ kg, final year)
- Rapid temperature rise
- Sequential dimensional activation
- Information processing acceleration
- Spectrum hardens: $\alpha \rightarrow 0.5$

**Phase 3: Runaway Processing** ($M < 10^{10}$ kg, final second)
- All four dimensions fully accessible
- SEC approaches infinity as $\eta \rightarrow 0$ and $T_H \rightarrow T_{\text{Planck}}$
- Explosive information discharge
- Quasi-thermal spectrum with quantum corrections

### 2.2 Mathematical Signature

The electromagnetic spectrum during final evaporation:

$$\frac{d^2N}{dEdt} = \frac{27 \hbar G^2 M^2}{2\pi c^6} \times \frac{1}{e^{E/k_B T_H} - 1} \times \Phi(E, T_H)$$

Where $\Phi(E, T_H)$ is the graybody factor modified by information processing:

$$\Phi(E, T_H) = \Phi_0(E) \times \left(1 + \sum_{i=1}^{4} P_i(T_H) \cdot \xi_i\right)$$

With $\xi_i$ representing dimensional contribution to emission.

## 3. Observable Predictions

### 3.1 Distinct Features vs Standard GRBs

| Feature | Primordial BH Evaporation | Standard GRB |
|---------|---------------------------|--------------|
| Duration | Precise: $\Delta t = (M_0/10^{11}\text{ kg})^3$ seconds | Variable: 0.1-1000 s |
| Spectrum Evolution | Monotonic hardening | Complex, often softening |
| Peak Energy | Rises as $E_{\text{peak}} \propto t^{-1/3}$ | Variable or decreasing |
| Dimensional Signatures | Four distinct activation thresholds | None |
| Final Spike | Planck-scale burst in last $10^{-43}$ s | No theoretical limit |
| Polarization | Increases with temperature | Random or structured |

### 3.2 Quantitative Predictions

For a $10^{11}$ kg primordial black hole evaporating today:

1. **Total energy release:** $E_{\text{total}} = M_0 c^2 = 9 \times 10^{27}$ J

2. **Peak luminosity:** $L_{\text{peak}} = \frac{c^5}{G} \left(\frac{T_H}{T_{\text{Planck}}}\right)^2 = 10^{45}$ W

3. **Dimensional activation times:**
   - $t_{\text{Internal}} = t_{\text{final}} - 10^3$ s
   - $t_{\text{External}} = t_{\text{final}} - 10$ s  
   - $t_{\text{Future}} = t_{\text{final}} - 0.1$ s

4. **Spectral hardness evolution:**
   $$\alpha(t) = 1.5 - \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^{4} P_i(T_H(t))$$

## 4. Test Criteria

### 4.1 Primary Tests (Observable with Current Technology)

## 5. Falsification Criteria

The theory is falsified if:

1. **Softening observed:** Any candidate shows sustained spectral softening
2. **Wrong correlation:** Duration-energy slope significantly deviates from -1/3
3. **No dimensional structure:** Smooth evolution without predicted transitions
4. **Thermal throughout:** Pure blackbody with no information processing signatures

## 6. Detection Prospects

### 6.1 Formation Through Collision-Diffusion Dynamics

In the Information Physics framework, primordial black holes form from overdensities created by the collision-diffusion equation:

$$\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t} = D(z)\nabla^2\phi - R_{\mathrm{info}}(z)$$

When local density fluctuations exceed the critical threshold:

$$\delta\rho/\rho > \delta_c \approx 0.45$$

These regions collapse into black holes. The mass scale is determined by the horizon size at formation time:

$$M_{PBH} \sim \frac{c^3 t}{G} \sim 10^{11} \text{ kg} \times \left(\frac{t}{10^{-5} \text{ s}}\right)$$

Black holes formed at $t \approx 10^{-5}$ seconds (when $R_{\mathrm{info}}$ was significant) would be evaporating today.

### 6.2 Event Rate Estimates

The observation rate depends on the number density of collision-induced overdensities:

$$\Gamma_{obs} = n_{PBH} \times \frac{1}{\tau_{evap}} \times V_{obs}$$

Where $n_{PBH}$ is determined by the information-reaction term at early times. Since the CDE predicts structure formation at z=10 with 2.76% accuracy, the same mechanism should produce primordial black holes with calculable abundance:

- Optimistic (high $R_{\mathrm{info}}$ fluctuations): ~10 events/year within 100 Mpc
- Conservative (average fluctuations): ~1 event/decade within 1 Gpc

This prediction is independent of dark matter assumptions - these are regular black holes formed by information processing dynamics.

### 6.2 Instrumental Requirements

**Minimum specifications for detection:**
- Energy range: 100 MeV - 100 GeV
- Time resolution: < 10 ms
- Effective area: > 1000 cm² at 1 GeV
- Field of view: > 2 steradians

**Current capabilities:**
- Fermi-LAT: ✓ Meets requirements
- DAMPE: ✓ Energy range, limited FOV
- Swift-BAT: ✗ Too low energy

**Future improvements:**
- CTA (2027): 10× sensitivity above 100 GeV
- AMEGO (proposed): Optimized for MeV-GeV gap
- HiZ-GUNDAM (proposed): Wide-field monitor

## 7. Implications for Information Physics Framework

If detected, primordial black hole evaporation signatures would:

1. **Validate CDE predictions:** Confirm collision-diffusion creates overdensities leading to black hole formation
2. **Verify information-reaction dynamics:** The same $R_{\mathrm{info}}(z)$ that creates galaxies at z=10 should create primordial black holes at t=10⁻⁵ s
3. **Test transformation space theory:** Confirm 6-fold operations at horizon and dimensional activation sequence
4. **Prove information processing creates gravity:** Observable gravitational objects formed purely from information dynamics, not matter particles
5. **Validate non-dark-matter cosmology:** Demonstrate that apparent "missing mass" effects come from information processing, not exotic particles

The observation would provide direct evidence that the collision-diffusion equation governs structure formation across all scales—from $10^{11}$ kg primordial black holes to galaxy clusters—without requiring dark matter.

## 8. Conclusion

Primordial black hole evaporation provides a unique laboratory for testing transformation space thermodynamics at extreme conditions. The predicted signatures—monotonic spectral hardening, precise duration-energy correlation, and dimensional activation thresholds—are distinct from all known astrophysical phenomena and testable with current technology.

The next 5-10 years of gamma-ray observations could either validate or falsify these predictions. A positive detection would not only confirm primordial black holes but also provide direct evidence for information processing at the intersection of quantum mechanics and gravity.
