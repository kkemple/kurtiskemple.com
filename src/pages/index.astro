Despite having vastly superior technology, global connectivity, and massive venture capital, Silicon Valley may produce significantly fewer innovators per capita than a 15th century Italian city-state. This framework proposes that entropy accumulation, not cultural factors, makes innovation exponentially harder. Further empirical validation would be required to confirm these theoretical predictions."
