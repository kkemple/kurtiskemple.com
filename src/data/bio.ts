    "Kurt Kemple’s first-principles approach was forged in unconventional conditions—he taught himself to code while incarcerated, then spent nearly two decades building product and platform strategy across Integral Ad Science, Major League Soccer, Amazon, Apollo, Slack, and Salesforce. Along the way he created economic frameworks such as the Friction Economy, Frustration Coalitions, and Bounded Reflexivity, which map how system friction and user sentiment evolve into competitive regime shifts. Today he blends DevRel leadership, AI platform design, and competitive intelligence to spot threats 12–18 months before consensus and translate them into winning playbooks.",
  long: `Kemple's approach was shaped by an unconventional path. He taught himself to code while incarcerated, developing a first-principles orientation that remains central to his work. Over nearly two decades, he built product and platform strategy at companies including Integral Ad Science, Major League Soccer, Amazon, Apollo, Slack, and Salesforce—spanning high-growth startups to S&P 500 enterprises.

Throughout this work, Kemple developed original economic frameworks that formalize the patterns preceding market shifts and competitive disruption. The Friction Economy describes how accumulated system friction creates predictable pressure gradients. Frustration Coalitions explains how user dissatisfaction organizes into competitive threats before traditional metrics detect them. Bounded Reflexivity models how coordination and narrative bandwidth interact to produce nonlinear transitions. These frameworks have been validated against real market data, identifying competitive threats and regime transitions 12–18 months ahead of consensus recognition.

Kemple is a keynote speaker and the author of several technical books, including *Effective DevRel* (Apress) and an upcoming work on designing AI platforms that scale. His writing and speaking extend directly from these frameworks—constraint economics, competitive intelligence, and the structural dynamics of platforms and markets.

He is currently pursuing a physics degree at The Open University in the UK, formalizing the mathematical foundations of his constraint work. Markets, grids, and organizational systems all behave as finite-capacity channels under pressure, and the geometry of physical phase transitions maps onto economic regime transitions.`,
