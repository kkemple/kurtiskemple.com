In the fast-paced world of Developer Relations (DevRel), there's a phenomenon I like to call YAP - "Yet Another Program." It's a challenge that many DevRel teams face as they grow and expand their initiatives. But what exactly is YAP, and how can we counter it? Let's dive in.

## Understanding YAP

YAP, or the "Yet Another Program" syndrome, stems from the unique cross-functional nature of DevRel. While roles in marketing, product management, or engineering certainly involve cross-functional collaboration, DevRel professionals often need to reach further both internally and externally (i.e., working directly with developers) than folks in adjacent teams, at least until you hit leadership roles. This broader scope comes with two significant challenges:

1. **Higher Skill Requirements**: DevRel roles often demand a wider range of cross-functional competencies. Even junior advocates need to navigate complex organizational structures and collaborate with diverse teams, both internally and in the developer community.

2. **Increased Need for Alignment**: The further our work extends beyond our immediate team, the more alignment we need for success. This necessitates more program management - syncs, office hours, workflows, documentation, and more.

As DevRel teams take on more initiatives - podcasts, content creation, events, etc. - the program management overhead grows exponentially. Eventually, we hit an inflection point where teams spend more time managing programs than participating in them, leading to decreased output and program success.

## Countering YAP: Operationalize and Automate

To counter YAP, we need to focus on operationalizing and automating our DevRel efforts. The goal is to make our work:

- **Consistent**: Repeatable processes that maintain quality
- **Clear**: Well-documented and easily understood
- **Communicable**: Easy to share and report on

Here are some strategies we've implemented:

### 1. Content Library

We've created a centralized content library that houses all our DevRel materials. This ensures consistency in messaging and makes it easy for team members to access and repurpose content.

### 2. Feedback Pipeline

We've established a structured feedback pipeline that captures insights from developers and routes them to the appropriate teams. This streamlines communication and ensures valuable feedback doesn't get lost.

### 3. Standardized Enablement

We've developed a tiered approach to customer enablement, with clear processes for each tier. This allows us to scale our efforts while maintaining quality.

### 4. DevRel Manager Role

We've introduced a DevRel Manager role focused on running programs. This frees up our advocates to participate in programs rather than managing them.

### 5. Automation

Leveraging tools like Slack Automation has been a game-changer. We've automated routine tasks, notifications, and even some content distribution, saving countless hours of manual work.

## Example: Separating Program Management from Participation

Let's look at how we've applied these principles to our enablement program. We've structured it into three tiers, each with clear roles that separate program management from program participation:

### Tier 1: High-Touch Onsite Enablement

- **Program Management (DevRel Manager)**:
  - Coordinate with customer stakeholders to schedule one-day onsite visits
  - Arrange logistics for travel and onsite needs
  - Prepare pre-visit briefing materials for advocates
  - Coordinate follow-up technical check-ins
  - Track API usage metrics and gather technical feedback
  - Analyze results and prepare reports for stakeholders

- **Program Participation (Advocates)**:
  - Prepare technical content and materials for the workshop
  - Deliver advanced workshops for top priority teams
  - Engage with high-priority teams to gather strategic insights

### Tier 2: Virtual Live Enablement

- **Program Management (DevRel Manager)**:
  - Schedule and set up virtual workshop series
  - Handle registrations and communications
  - Track attendance, engagement, and post-webinar API adoption metrics
  - Analyze feedback and prepare reports

- **Program Participation (Advocates)**:
  - Prepare technical content for webinars and workshops
  - Deliver virtual technical workshops
  - Gather technical feedback during sessions
  - Propose content adjustments based on developer needs

### Tier 3: Self-Serve Resources

- **Program Management (DevRel Manager)**:
  - Coordinate content creation schedule
  - Ensure alignment with overall enablement strategy
  - Manage the existing centralized hub resources related to enablement
  - Track resource usage, course completions, and resulting API adoption
  - Analyze data to identify areas for improvement

- **Program Participation (Advocates)**:
  - Create and maintain enablement material
  - Propose updates and new content based on usage data and developer feedback

By clearly delineating these roles, we ensure that our DevRel Advocates can focus on what they do best - engaging with developers and creating valuable content - while the DevRel Manager handles the operational aspects of running the program.

## The Benefits of Operationalization and Automation

By focusing on operationalization and automation, we've seen several benefits:

1. **Increased Productivity**: Our team spends less time on repetitive tasks and more time on high-impact activities.

2. **Improved Consistency**: Automated processes ensure a consistent experience for developers interacting with our platform.

3. **Better Scalability**: We can take on new initiatives without proportionally increasing our management overhead.

4. **Enhanced Measurement**: Automated systems make it easier to track and report on our efforts, providing valuable insights for optimization.

5. **Reduced Burnout**: By eliminating much of the tedious program management work, our team stays energized and focused on what they do best.

## Conclusion

The YAP syndrome is a real challenge in DevRel, but it's not insurmountable. By focusing on operationalization and automation, we can create more efficient, effective, and scalable DevRel programs. It's not about doing less - it's about doing more of what matters by working smarter.

Remember, the goal of DevRel is to build and nurture developer communities, drive adoption, and gather valuable feedback. By countering YAP, we free ourselves to focus on these core objectives, ultimately delivering more value to both our organizations and the developer communities we serve.
