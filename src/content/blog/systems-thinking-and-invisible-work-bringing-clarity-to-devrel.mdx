In Developer Relations (DevRel), success often hinges on our ability to see the big picture while simultaneously managing intricate details. This is where systems thinking and the recognition of invisible work become invaluable tools. By employing these approaches, we can dramatically improve our reporting, enhance team understanding, and create more aligned career paths.

## The Power of Systems Thinking in DevRel

Systems thinking in DevRel involves viewing our work as an interconnected whole rather than isolated parts. It's about understanding how different activities — from documentation to community engagement to product feedback — influence and depend on each other.

For instance, at Slack, we've implemented a tiered approach for customer enablement focused on our top 100 Platform Weekly Active User (WAU) teams. This project isn't just about providing technical support; it's about understanding how different levels of engagement affect developer success and platform adoption. 

Our tiered approach includes:

1. High-Touch Onsite Enablement for top priority teams
2. Virtual Live Enablement for mid-priority teams
3. Self-Serve Resources for all teams

By mapping out these connections, we've been able to create a comprehensive strategy that addresses the needs of various customer segments while maximizing our resources. This systems approach has allowed us to clearly define roles within our team. For example, our DevRel Manager oversees program strategy and execution, handles logistics coordination, and manages stakeholder relationships. Meanwhile, our Developer Advocates focus on content creation, workshop delivery, and gathering technical insights from high-priority teams.

This structured approach allows us to provide tailored support based on a team's current usage, growth potential, and strategic importance, while ensuring our team operates efficiently and effectively.

## Uncovering Invisible Work

Invisible work in DevRel encompasses tasks that are crucial but often go unnoticed or unquantified. This might include relationship building with key community members, providing ad-hoc support, or continuously learning about new technologies to stay relevant.

At Slack, we recognized this issue and created a Top Contributors recognition program. This initiative not only rewards active community members but also makes visible the ongoing work of nurturing and maintaining these valuable relationships. The program has led to increased engagement and a more vibrant developer community.

## Benefits of Visualizing Systems and Work

When we make systems and invisible work visible, we unlock numerous benefits:

1. **Improved reporting and metrics**: By capturing the full scope of DevRel impact, we can create more comprehensive and meaningful reports. This allows us to better align our metrics with broader business goals and demonstrate the true value of DevRel activities.

2. **Enhanced team understanding**: Visualizing our work helps clarify roles and responsibilities within the team. It also fosters cross-functional collaboration by making it clear how different roles interact and depend on each other.

3. **Better resource allocation**: With a clearer picture of all ongoing work, we can more easily identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies. This allows for more effective prioritization of high-impact activities and optimal resource allocation.

## Refining Job Responsibilities

Systems thinking and work visibility directly contribute to more refined and effective job responsibilities. By understanding the full scope of work being done, we can create more comprehensive role descriptions that accurately reflect the demands of each position.

For example, in our Developer Advocacy Career Ladder at Slack, we've outlined clear competencies and responsibilities for each level. This includes not just the visible outputs like creating content or speaking at events, but also the less tangible skills like building relationships and providing strategic insights. This comprehensive approach ensures that all aspects of the role are recognized and valued.

## Developing Clearer Career Ladders

A systems-based approach also allows for the development of more coherent and aligned career ladders. By mapping out the skills and competencies needed across different levels and roles, we can provide clear pathways for growth and development.

Our Documentation Engineering Career Ladder at Slack illustrates this approach. It outlines a progression from Associate Documentation Engineer to Principal Documentation Engineer, detailing how responsibilities and expected impact evolve at each level. This clarity helps team members understand their current position and what they need to do to advance, promoting engagement and retention.

## Implementing Systems Thinking and Work Visibility

Adopting these approaches requires deliberate effort and tools. Some strategies include:

1. Creating visual maps of workflows and interdependencies.
2. Implementing regular "invisible work" audits to ensure nothing is slipping throught the cracks.
3. Using project management tools to track both tangible outputs and ongoing relational work.
4. Regularly reviewing and updating job descriptions and career ladders to reflect the full scope of work.

By integrating these practices into our regular workflows, we can ensure that all valuable work is recognized and that our teams are aligned towards common goals.

## Conclusion

Systems thinking and making invisible work visible are powerful tools for DevRel teams. They enable us to create more accurate reports, foster better team understanding, refine job responsibilities, and develop clearer career paths. By adopting these approaches, we can unlock our teams' full potential and drive more meaningful impact in the developer community.
