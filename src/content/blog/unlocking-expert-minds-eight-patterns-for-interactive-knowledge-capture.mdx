Lately, I've been diving deeper into the idea of expert intelligence while exploring innovative approaches to capture specialized human knowledge. These methods go beyond traditional surveys or static interviews to create more comprehensive expert intelligence.

Today, I want to discuss how we can leverage the latest advancements in AI to capture knowledge in groundbreaking ways.

## Concept â€” AI-guided Interviews

At the core of these ideas are guided interviews: dynamic, AI-driven sessions that could record information while actively steering the conversation. These systems might adapt their questioning in real time, engaging experts in a deeper exploration of their knowledge, etc. While still conceptual, this approach could transform how we preserve and leverage expertise across various fields.

This guided interactivity sets these approaches apart from conventional expertise capture methods. The system doesn't just passively collect data; it's designed to probe, challenge, and even surprise the expert, potentially uncovering insights that might not emerge in a standard interview or knowledge-mapping session.

Here are eight patterns I plan to explore, each leveraging this unique guided interview approach:

## 1. Body of Work Discovery: Retrospective Analysis

In this pattern, a guided system leads an expert through a review of their professional accomplishments, dynamically adjusting its inquiries based on the expert's responses and the patterns it detects.

For instance, as a researcher discusses their published works, the system might notice a recurring methodological approach and prompt: "I've observed you frequently use this specific technique. Can you elaborate on how it evolved over these three projects?" This adaptive questioning could reveal underlying themes or innovations the expert hadn't consciously recognized.

The power of this approach lies in its ability to uncover invisible threads of influence and evolution, potentially providing experts with new insights into their developmental trajectory.

## 2. Goal Achievement Journey: Enhanced Milestone Mapping

Here, an intelligent interviewer guides experts through their career trajectories, using advanced language processing to identify critical milestones and decision points. The system then dives deeper into these moments with targeted questions.

For example, if an expert mentions a career change, the system might inquire: "You shifted from academia to industry at this point. What skills from your academic work proved most unexpected in their industrial applications?" This dynamic probing could uncover valuable insights about skill transferability and adaptation.

This approach could be particularly effective for experts whose path involves clear milestones. It could help uncover forgotten events, draw connections between disparate experiences, and even identify pivotal moments that the expert might have overlooked.

## 3. Concept Map Exploration: Dynamic Knowledge Graph Construction

In this interactive pattern, as an expert outlines key concepts in their field, the system suggests connections and prompts for clarification in real-time. The system's ability to challenge the expert's conceptual framework is unique.

For instance, it might propose: "Based on recent papers in your field, concept X seems to contradict your definition of concept Y. How would you reconcile these ideas?" This kind of prompting could lead to real-time refinement of the expert's mental models.

This pattern could shine in fields with vast, complex knowledge bases, with the system not just passively recording but actively participating in the knowledge mapping process.

## 4. Decision-Making Scenario Builder: Adaptive Decision Tree Analysis

This pattern involves presenting experts with evolving scenarios and adapting each subsequent situation based on the expert's previous decisions. The system's ability to generate complex, branching scenarios in real-time sets this approach apart.

For example, in a business context, it might follow up a decision with: "Given your choice to expand into Market A, you're now facing unexpected regulatory challenges. How does this impact your next steps?" This dynamic scenario building could reveal nuances in the expert's decision-making process that static case studies might miss.

This pattern could be invaluable for experts in fields requiring complex, high-stakes decisions. The system would not just record decisions but also challenge assumptions and help experts refine their decision-making frameworks.

## 5. Skill Deconstruction Workshop: Micro-Skill Analysis

In this pattern, the system guides experts through demonstrations of complex skills, using real-time video and audio analysis to identify micro-movements or decision points that the expert might perform subconsciously.

For instance, while a surgeon demonstrates a procedure, the system might interrupt: "I've noticed you adjust your grip in a specific way at this stage. Can you explain the reasoning behind this subtle movement?" This interactive analysis could uncover tacit knowledge that the expert might not typically articulate.

For experts whose skills involve complex physical techniques or rapid cognitive processes, this approach could serve as both a magnifying glass and an analyst, revealing and categorizing the often invisible components of expert performance.

## 6. Trend Analysis and Prediction: Enhanced Foresight Mapping

Here, the system engages experts in a dynamic forecasting session, presenting real-time data and challenging predictions as they're made. The key is the ability to cross-reference expert insights with vast datasets instantly.

For example, as an expert predicts industry trends, the system might interject: "Your prediction conflicts with emerging data from Sector B. How might this information alter your forecast?" This real-time challenge and validation process could lead to more robust and well-considered predictions.

This pattern could be crucial for experts whose value lies in their ability to navigate uncertainty and anticipate change. The system could act as both a fact-checker and a co-pilot in refining predictive models.

## 7. Problem-Solving Protocol Capture: Heuristic Extraction

In this pattern, the system presents experts with problems, dynamically generating new challenges based on the expert's problem-solving approach. Creating novel, relevant issues in real-time is crucial here.

For instance, after observing an expert's approach to several problems, it might propose: "Based on your methods so far, here's a hybrid problem combining elements you've addressed separately. How would you approach this new challenge?" This adaptive problem generation could help articulate the expert's underlying problem-solving heuristics.

This pattern could be particularly valuable for experts who routinely tackle diverse, complex problems. The system could serve as both a documentarian and a sparring partner in articulating and refining problem-solving frameworks.

## 8. Collaborative Knowledge Refinement: Moderated Evolutionary Learning

This pattern envisions the system as an active moderator in expert discussions, facilitating and actively contributing to the dialogue. It could identify disagreement points, suggest collaborative focus areas, and even play devil's advocate.

For example, the moderator might interject in a panel discussion: "Expert A's view seems to contradict Expert B's earlier statement about X. Could you both elaborate on this apparent discrepancy?" This active moderation could drive more profound, more productive expert interactions.

This approach acknowledges that expertise isn't static, capturing how expert knowledge evolves and responds to new information or challenges.

## Conclusion: The Potential of Guided Interactive Expertise Capture

The core innovation in these patterns lies in the system's active, adaptive interviewer and facilitator role. Unlike traditional methods where the structure is primarily predetermined, these guided sessions are designed to be highly dynamic, with each question and prompt shaped by ongoing dialogue and emerging insights.

This approach could offer several advantages:

1. **Personalization**: The system can tailor inquiries to each expert's unique experiences and communication style.
2. **Depth**: Identifying and probing subtle points might uncover layers of expertise that traditional methods might miss.
3. **Challenge**: The system can present alternative viewpoints or contradictory data, encouraging experts to articulate and defend their knowledge more thoroughly.
4. **Synthesis**: Connecting ideas across different parts of the conversation could help experts form new insights about their expertise.

I'm particularly interested in how this guided interactivity might reshape our understanding of expertise and what doors it may unlock. These guided interactive patterns represent a shift from static knowledge capture to a more dynamic, exploratory process of expertise articulation and refinement. As I continue to develop and test these approaches, I hope to uncover new dimensions of human expertise and find innovative ways to preserve, evolve, and distribute specialized knowledge.

As I venture further into this exploration, the potential for a new connection between human knowledge and intelligent systems becomes apparent. I don't want to just record or replicate expert knowledge; I'm trying to create an environment where expertise can be articulated, challenged, and evolved in unprecedented ways.

Capturing and understanding expert knowledge in this new context is an ongoing endeavor, one that could reshape how we approach complex problems and drive innovation across countless fields.
