## Abstract

Information Physics proposes a unifying theoretical and mathematical framework describing how conscious agents embedded in entropy modify system trajectories through observer-dependent operations. The theory defines three irreducible operations—`MOVE`, `JOIN`, and `SEPARATE`—as the only mechanisms by which boundaries (informational, organizational, spatial, cognitive) transform. These operations interact with an agent's positional entropy (`E`), directional intent (`V`), and operational capacity (`O`) to generate measurable effects on system entropy, captured by the core equation:

`SEC = O × V / (1 + E)`

Building on the established equivalence between Shannon information entropy and thermodynamic entropy, the theory extends these foundations to explain cognitive and social dynamics, organizational change, innovation cycles, and large-scale civilizational evolution. Conscious Chaos, a recent theoretical extension, introduces time-sensitivity and perturbation dynamics into the model via:

`dSEC/dt = O × V × f(E) × [1 + α·sin(ωt)]`

This evolution function allows entropy trajectory modeling under stress, fatigue, or emergent alignment, integrating concepts from chaos theory, percolation thresholds, and attractor basins.

The theory accounts for:

* Nash Equilibrium as entropic exhaustion (`ΔSEC/ΔO ≈ 0`)
* Mass extinction patterns (SEC generalist > specialist)
* Organizational collapse and crowd behavior (percolation + high-E systems)
* Innovation density (entropy explains historical disparities)
* Real energetic cost of cognition and decision-making (Landauer's principle + E)

Information Physics introduces a minimal viable modeling system using `E`, `V`, `O`, `α`, and `ω` to simulate conscious systems under thermodynamic constraint. Its explanatory power spans neural networks, economic behavior, agent-based modeling, and planetary survivability.

This framework may provide the first cross-scale, observer-embedded mathematical theory for understanding how physical consciousness interacts with entropy—not passively, but transformatively.

While theoretical predictions align with observed patterns across multiple domains, systematic empirical validation remains necessary to establish the framework's validity.
