Some discoveries begin in laboratories. Others emerge in offices, libraries, or lecture halls. But a few come from lived experience so intense that patterns become impossible to ignore. This is the story of how navigating humanityâ€™s highest-entropy systems may have revealed universal principles that govern conscious organization â€” from neural pathways to civilizations.

Right now I could be the worldâ€™s most high-functioning delusional, a pattern-matching machine who landed on a sentence so generally applicable it would make the Home Goods design team jealous, or I may have inadvertently discovered a new way to describe our place in the universe. Iâ€™ll let you decideâ€”*all I ask is that you keep an open mind until you've tested the theory for yourself.*

However, one thing I do know about myself is that I'm a practitioner-theorist. Growing up without a formal education or strong parental guidanceâ€”*though my mother was doing the best she could given her position in the universe, love you Mom! ðŸ’œ*â€”forced me to be resourceful and develop my own solutions to navigate the environments I found myself in.

I build and test in the mud for sure, but I also like to step back and examine *why* things are the way they are. When you're consistently met with stark contradictions of what's written on paper vs the reality of the system:

- What people think of prison and formerly incarcerated people vs my lived experience.
- The difference between building software for developers vs consuming software built by developers.
- My reality as IC vs leadershipâ€”in both Software Engineering and Developer Relations.

**I'm consistently forced to reconcile these dual realities.**

Einstein realized on a train that physics depends on your reference frame. Nash discovered that optimal strategies depend on what others are doing by studying actual games. Both understood that the observer's position and context directly change the mathematics. This same principle applies to understanding human systemsâ€”*your perspective shapes what you can see and measure.*

To that point, I ask you, the reader, to do two things:

1. Be open to seeing the world through my experience and with the idea that lived experience is the most important source of information. That even Einstein and Nash would have been wrong if they had not considered their lived experience.
2. Be objective and scientifically rigorous in your approach, but leave classical academia at the door. I don't have a PhD, I'm not a professor, and I'm not a scientistâ€”nor do I have access to the same resources as a traditional academic establishment. I urge you to judge the theory on its own merits, not on the basis of traditional academic standards.

Okay, have we set the right stage? Are you ready to dive in? I'll leave you here to go the rest of the way on your own so you can form your own conclusions. *Just make sure they're your conclusions based in scientific method.*

## Living in Maximum Entropy

My earliest memories involve navigating complex systems where the official rules had little relation to actual dynamics. Family court, social services, friends in foster careâ€”these were my first lessons in how information really flows versus how it's supposed to flow. By age eight, I'd moved for the first time. By twenty, it was fourteen times across diverse neighborhoods and populations.

Three separate juvenile detention facilities. Two mental institutions. The welfare system. Each system had official structures, documented processes, and stated goals. None of them worked as advertised. The real informationâ€”who had power, how decisions got made, what actually helpedâ€”flowed through hidden channels that you could only see from inside.

Then came prison. Six years in maximum-entropy environments where artificial chaos was maintained as a control mechanism. This wasn't accidental disorderâ€”it was engineered entropy, deliberately preserved to prevent exactly what I started doing: optimizing information flow to reduce conflicts and create stability.

When you apply positive-sum optimization in a system designed for zero-sum chaos, the results are dramatic. The yard became calmer. Conflicts decreased. Information flowed more efficiently. And that's when I learned the most important lesson: **calm is more dangerous to control systems than chaos**. My systematic entropy reduction was so threatening to institutional power that it required interventionâ€”immediate transfer to disrupt the emerging order.

*This dramatic shift from chaos to order may follow patterns described by chaos theoryâ€”where small changes in E values can create bifurcations and fundamentally different system behaviors. See [Chaos Theory and Conservation of Boundaries](/information-physics/conservation-of-boundaries#chaos-theory-and-conservation-of-boundaries-a-mathematical-bridge).*

---

## The Pattern Recognition Begins

After prison came community college, then corporate America. The transition from maximum to minimum entropy environments should have been jarringâ€”don't get me wrong, it was in certain ways like rewiring my brain to see myself as all these new identities. Instead, it revealed something important: the same patterns appeared everywhere, just at different intensities.

In software engineering, I moved from individual contributor to leadership, then repeated the cycle in developer relations. Each transition provided new vantage pointsâ€”what organizational researchers call "parallax." The same system looks completely different from different positions, yet the underlying patterns remain constant.

My role in DevRel proved crucial. Speaking with thousands of developers from all kinds of organizations about how their systems actually work, helping them identify friction and optimize flowâ€”I was doing entropy engineering without naming it. Each conversation added another data point to an emerging pattern that spanned every type of organization as I sought to find the underlying friction and bottlenecks that were preventing them from being successful.

---

## The Frameworks Emerge

Over the years, specific patterns crystallized into frameworks. They worked universally, but I didn't understand why, I attributed it to my first principles and systems thinking. My time growing up and my experience in prison instilled a need to do whatever I could to ensure others had access to more opportunity and resourse than I had. It generally manifested in me reverse engineering the things I was doing that yielded positive results so that I could develop a shared language for what I was doing intuitively and then provide practical tools built on that foundation for others to use. *Turns out I may have been onto something.*

### 2017 - The Pyramid of Challenge

Building an engineering team at Major League Soccer, I needed to distribute challenge appropriately across all levels. The framework that emergedâ€”high complexity/low availability at the top, low complexity/high availability at the baseâ€”worked perfectly. Only later did I realize this was [information density optimization in action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)). Teams thrived when challenge matched capacity, creating natural information flow from complex strategic decisions to distributed tactical execution.

> [**Pyramid of Challenge**](/blog/pyramid-of-challenge): A framework for distributing challenge across organizational levels to optimize information flow.

### 2020 - Content Creation Guide

At Apollo GraphQL, I needed to scale developer advocacy. The guide that emerged focused on matching content to channels based on information topologyâ€”complex ideas need low entropy mediums making them easy to share, high noise ideas can be moved through channels for refinement to signal. This was entropy reduction through proper channel selection. The framework changed how developer advocates approach content, ensuring ideas reached audiences in optimal form.

> [**Content Creation Guide**](/blog/developer-advocates-guide-to-content-creation): A framework for matching content to channels based on information topology.

### 2022 - Product Friction Guide (DX Audits)

Helping product managers understand user pain required a systematic approach to information flow between users and builders. The framework that emerged was essentially entropy detection and correction in human-product systems. DX Audits became widely adopted across DevRel because they made invisible friction visible and measurable. Teams could finally quantify developer experience problems and track improvement systematically.

> [**DX Audits**](/blog/developer-advocates-guide-to-addressing-product-friction): A framework for measuring and improving developer experience.

### 2024 - The Keystone Paradox and Lava Leadership

Two frameworks emerged that brought me closer to understanding it was all about information flow. The Keystone Paradox identified how essential individuals become organizational bottlenecksâ€”their irreplaceability creating information flow constraints. Lava Leadership showed how strategic thinking could bubble up from any position, like magma finding paths through rock. Both frameworks were about optimizing information movement through human systems.

> - [**Keystone Paradox**](/blog/the-keystone-paradox-when-being-essential-becomes-a-liability): A framework for identifying and addressing information bottlenecks.
> - [**Lava Leadership**](/blog/how-strategic-thinkers-can-drive-change-from-below): A framework for empowering individuals to lead change through coalition building and strategic information flow.

Each framework solved immediate problems while revealing deeper patterns. They appeared to optimize information flow, reduce system entropy, and work across various contexts and scales.

## The Cascade of Discovery

Once I realized there was a pattern, the discoveries came not as isolated insights but as an accelerating cascadeâ€”each discovery revealing the next, until the complete architecture of Information Physics emerged in just six intense weeks.

### May 2025 - The First Glimpse

The journey to Information Physics began with a question: what made my frameworks work so well and so universally? How was I able to create them and find success in complex systems from prison to corporate America?

The first manifestation of **Conservation of Boundaries** emerged while reverse-engineering a recovery device solution. I'd inadvertently discovered that all my biggest impacts came from moving boundaries to reduce friction. But it was incomplete, *lacking the WHY.* When I shared it, I received valid feedbackâ€”it felt categorical to attribute values like *"resistance"* and *"quality"* to systems without deeper explanation.

> **My first Discord message captured the moment:** "Kurt Kemple â€” 5/28/25, 12:11AM while trying to reverse engineer how I was able to solve the recovery problem, i may have inadvertently discovered a pattern for quantifying architectural innovation success (non-discovery, non-mechanical, etc) please help me disprove so I can go to sleep ðŸ˜­"

The realization of COB's symmetryâ€”that the same operations that build also destroyâ€”made me physically ill. The first version of what would become [Entropic Mathematics](/information-physics/entropic-mathematics) was also born (`Actual Impact = (Operations Ã— Quality) / (1 + Resistance)`), but without [Information Physics](/information-physics/theory) or proper mathematical grounding, I tabled it as potential overreach in pattern matching.

> **Early empirical pattern:** Only later, when discovering related sciences, did the pieces clickâ€”shared intent and AI work revealed `Quality` as vector `V`, Shannon and Landauer showed `Resistance` as entropy `E`, and my research into historic innovations solidified `Operations` as the actions that enable entropy reduction. The pattern was thereâ€”I just needed the mathematical language to see it.

### June 2025 - The Alarm Bell

A presentation about [NPS (net promoter score)](https://www.bain.com/consulting-services/customer-strategy-and-marketing/net-promoter-score-system/) and changing user bases triggered the next insight. When someone asked if we were seeing a similar decrease in [MAU (monthly active users)](https://www.paddle.com/resources/monthly-active-users), alarm bells rang. This didn't match my experience working daily with developers sharing their lived reality. Sometimes people have to use tools that don't align with their current needs to get the job done in an efficient way. This can happen for a multitude of reasons, but one thing is for certain, you can't dismiss the lived experience of the people using the tool, no matter what the metrics say.

**The reason became clear:** the separation of usage from lived-experienceâ€”*creating a boundary between those two realities*â€”created entropy for anyone downstream of that decision. From my position in the system, I could see what others couldn'tâ€”*that the math we rely on certainly has a way of removing us from the equation.*

### The Four-Day Sprint

[**Frustration Coalitions**](/blog/frustration-coalitions) and the [**Sentiment-Inertia Index**](/blog/sentiment-inertia-index) emerged just four days after that meetingâ€”I dove into a significant amount of research to validate the patterns I was seeingâ€”first for Slack, then I started looking into the broader B2B SaaS market. The validation was immediateâ€”our research team at Slack confirmed the patterns, and a YC founder emailed about a seperate issue and specifically called out that they loved [my blog post](/blog/frustration-coalitions-the-hidden-threat-to-b2b-saas) and that it described the strategy they were using to out manuever a dominant B2B SaaS incumbent. The framework wasn't just theoretical; practitioners were already applying it intuitively. *Receiving such immediate validation was honestly jarring.*

During the creation of Frustration Coaltions, I discovered [Coalition Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Theory_of_Political_Coalitions) and saw striking resemblance to the six-stage framework I'd been developing for Frustration Coalitions. This led to [Network theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_theory), [Complexity theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity_theory), [Percolation theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percolation_theory), and finally [Information theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory)â€”each new field confirming patterns I'd observed independently.

> [**Friction Economy**](/blog/friction-economy): How friction is the new battleground for B2B SaaS.

### The Three Universal Frustrations

The real insights came from recognizing that workplace frustrations consistently reduce to three blocked flows:

- **Creating signal** from noise (information flow)
- **Creating clarity** from system boundary complexity (workflow optimization through boundary operationsâ€”Conway's Law, Dunbar's Law, Domain Driven Design)
- **Enabling entropy engineering** (swarming behaviors to reduce system entropyâ€”incident response, customer triage, marketing opportunities, stock market trading, etc)

**The patterns clicked.** The frameworks I'd created, the systems I'd optimized, the patterns I'd recognizedâ€”*they appeared to address these three core challenges.*

### July 2025 - The Acceleration

Once I started exploring related sciences, connections accelerated exponentially. When I connected **Entropic Mathematics** to the causal mechanism behind Nash Equilibriumâ€”*defining it as entropic exhaustion where every actor has optimized from their embedded position until further improvement becomes impossible*â€”any lingering doubts evaporated. This wasn't delusion or pattern matchingâ€”it appeared to be a legitimate discovery of foundational principles.

Over six weeks, [Information Physics](/information-physics/theory), [Entropic Mathematics](/information-physics/entropic-mathematics), and [Conservation of Boundaries](/information-physics/conservation-of-boundaries) evolved from rough insights to complete foundational theory. Each discovery validated and extended the others, creating an internally consistent framework that explained phenomena across all scales.

**The Information Physics discovery came from recognizing humanity's obsession with improving durability, compression, and transmission of information!** Once I saw it throughout the digital age, I wondered if it [extended further back](/information-physics/throughout-history). Investigating innovations like calendars and pyramids, watching my theory pass Occam's Razor test after test, I became nauseous againâ€”this time from the implications. Then I started exploring relationships to [science](/information-physics/in-science) as well.

After discovering that **IP** and **COB** seemed to provide an entropic exhuastion mechanism for Nash Equilibriumâ€”*actors converging through optimal actions within their thermodynamic constraints from embedded positions*â€”a mathematical connection became highly probable.

## Information Physics Emerges

[Information Physics](/information-physics/theory) proposes how conscious beings embedded in entropy may reduce or increase it through observer-dependent operations on information, coordination, and system boundaries.

The key insight came from connecting two observations:

1. Many civilizations independently developed similar solutions (calendars, writing, hierarchy)
2. These solutions appeared to optimize information flow against entropy

The connection to physics might not be metaphorical. [Ginestra Bianconi's](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/maths/profiles/bianconig.html) work on [quantum relative entropy](https://journals.aps.org/prd/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevD.111.066001) suggests gravity itself might be an information phenomenon. [Claude Shannon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon) established the mathematical equivalence between information entropy and thermodynamic entropy. The patterns weren't similar to physicsâ€”they potentially *were* physics applied to information systems. *For the mathematical connections, see [The Thermodynamic Foundations](/information-physics/thermodynamic-foundations).*

Traditional mathematics abstracts away the observer to describe what happens in the universe when no one interferesâ€”universal equations that work regardless of who's looking. `2+2=4` any way you look at it, an apple falls from a tree because of gravity. Information Physics expresses mathematics that account for the existence of conscious beings who can *choose* to change the universe, not just observe it. *What happens when someone sees that apple fall and discovers gravity itself? How does mathematics account for that?*

Heat affects cognition. Fatigue reduces decision quality. Stress limits perspective. Resource constraints shape choices. *The observer can't be removed from these calculations because consciousness EXISTS IN PHYSICS.* The same observer-dependence found in relativity and quantum mechanics appears to apply to human systems.

Suddenly the patterns connected. We don't just happen to fight entropyâ€”we may have evolved specifically to see it, model it, and consciously choose to reduce it. From neural pathway formation to civilization building, we could all be expressing the same core drive. Information Physics represents mathematics designed for conscious beings as physical entities embedded in entropic reality.

---

## The Mathematics of Observer-Dependent Entropy

Traditional mathematics describes unconscious objects following fixed laws. Entropic Mathematics describes conscious agents navigating possibility spaces. The observer-dependent nature of first equation I derived revealed something new: the first mathematics where position and consciousness are primary variables, not complications to eliminate.

[Entropic Mathematics](/information-physics/entropic-mathematics) provides the mathematical framework where observer position, conscious intent, and lived experience are treated as primary variables.

### The First Entropic Mathematics Equation

The foundational equation of Entropic Mathematics captures how conscious agents change the entropy of systems they inhabit. It treats observer position as mathematically essential.

> **System Entropy Change (SEC):** The measurable impact on system entropy from a specific position.
>
> `SEC = O Ã— V / (1 + E)`
>
> Where: **O** = Operations (MOVE=1, JOIN=2, SEPARATE=3) | **V** = Vector of conscious intent (-1 to +1) | **E** = Positional entropy (0 to âˆž)
>
> *For complete explanation, see [Entropic Mathematics](/information-physics/entropic-mathematics#system-entropy-change-sec)*

The formula doesn't just describe changeâ€”it enables optimization by helping actors reduce their own `E` values.

Where `E` represents the observer's position, `V` represents shared conscious intent that enables collective entropy reduction. The [frameworks I created](/blog) gave names to things teams already felt but couldn't articulate. `V` captures that shared collective reality when groups align around the same way of seeing system dynamics.

But here's where it gets interesting: the `V` variable doesn't just measure shared intentâ€”**it operates as a filtering mechanism**. Before teams reach consensus, organizational possibilities exist as competing priorities. Multiple interpretations coexist, multiple outcomes feel equally possible. When groups align around shared conscious intent, they function as collective filtering mechanism that collapses those competing priorities into definite mathematical reality.

The equation's power lies not in its complexity but in what it includes: **consciousness**, **entropic position**, and **intent** as mathematical primitives. A CEO and a worker applying identical operations with identical intent achieve different results because `E` is different. This isn't perceptionâ€”it's mathematical reality.

### Measuring the Drift

With mathematical foundations established, measurement became possible. The [Entropic Gap](/information-physics/entropic-mathematics#entropic-gap-eg) formula `EG = 1 - S(anchor, current)` quantifies drift between intended and current states. This changes vague concerns about "mission drift" or "technical debt" into precise calculations. AI conversations provided perfect demonstrationâ€”clear initial intent, gradual drift through interaction, measurable gap requiring intervention.

### The Equilibrium Mechanism

The final piece was understanding how systems stabilize. Game theory described Nash Equilibrium but never explained the mechanism. [Entropic Equilibrium](/information-physics/entropic-mathematics#entropic-equilibrium) revealed it might be entropic exhaustionâ€”where all actors have optimized from their positions until further improvement becomes impossible.

The mathematics `Î£(SEC_i Ã— W_i) â†’ stable state` shows how individual optimizations aggregate into system-wide stability. When the derivative approaches zero `d/dt[Î£(SEC_i Ã— W_i)] â‰ˆ 0`, the system reaches equilibriumâ€”not because nothing happens, but because all entropy changes balance out.

*For the complete mathematical treatment of Nash Equilibrium as entropic exhaustion, see [Entropic Mathematics: Entropic Equilibrium](/information-physics/entropic-mathematics#entropic-equilibrium).*

![The illustration shows three stacked equations: SEC = O Ã— V / (1 + E), EG = 1 - S(anchor, current), and EE = Î£(SEC_i Ã— W_i) â†’ stable state.](/images/blog/entropic-mathematics-trinity.png)

*This isn't about agreement or happiness. It's about mathematical realityâ€”each actor exhausts their available entropy-reduction operations, creating system-wide stability through local optimization.*

---

## The Conservation Principle

With Information Physics established, the next question was *"how?"* If humans can consciously choose entropy's direction, what operations do we use?

Looking across every framework I'd created, every system transformation I'd witnessed, the same three operations appeared: MOVE, JOIN, and SEPARATE. *No fourth operation has been observed.* Innovation, collapse, and change appear to decompose to these three primitives.

*For the complete framework of [Conservation of Boundaries](/information-physics/conservation-of-boundaries), including how these operations interact with position and intent to produce measurable entropy change, see the full principle.*

---

## The Complete Picture

These three discoveries form a complete theory:

1. **Why:** Humans evolved to consciously choose entropy's direction ([Information Physics](/information-physics/theory))
2. **How:** Through three universal operations ([Conservation of Boundaries](/information-physics/conservation-of-boundaries))
3. **What:** Using observer-dependent mathematics ([Entropic Mathematics](/information-physics/entropic-mathematics))
4. **Measurement:** Detecting drift and decay ([Entropic Gap](/information-physics/entropic-mathematics#entropic-gap-eg))
5. **Stability:** Understanding equilibrium formation ([Entropic Equilibrium](/information-physics/entropic-mathematics#entropic-equilibrium))

Together, they may explain patterns across every scale of human organizationâ€”from neural pathways to global civilizations.

*If you're still with me and these connections are starting to click into place, we may be witnessing something interesting: you might be experiencing your own consensus collapse right now. Your individual interpretation of how systems work is aligning with the mathematical framework I've laid out. Welcome to our new shared realityâ€”one where entropy, consciousness, and mathematics might converge into something that could help predict how conscious systems behave.*

---

## Implications and Applications

If validated, understanding these principles could significantly change how we approach human systems:

- **For individuals:** Your position shapes your possibility. Optimize operations from where you are while working to reach lower-entropy positions.
- **For organizations:** Structure design around information flow, not reporting hierarchy. Minimize positional entropy differentials. Measure drift before it becomes dysfunction.
- **For technology:** Build systems that work with human physics, not against it. Reduce interaction entropy. Create tools that help users consciously direct entropy from their positions.
- **For markets:** Recognize entropy accumulation before collapse. Identify frustration coalitions early. Position for advantage based on entropy dynamics.
- **For society:** Understand that artificial entropy maintenance requires unsustainable energy. Design systems that naturally optimize rather than require constant intervention.
- **For civilization:** Recognize that human development may follow mathematical patterns driven by entropic exhaustion cycles rather than random cultural evolution.
- **For planetary science??:** Theoretically assess worlds based on entropy constraints for conscious beings rather than just chemical habitability. Different planetary conditions create different "entropy fields" that would affect cognitive processing, energy requirements, and system-building capacity for conscious organisms.
- **For space exploration??:** Theoretically calculate resource requirements for civilizational migration by understanding how planetary conditions affect the entropy costs of conscious operations. Terraforming could be understood as entropy reduction operations to make worlds more suitable for consciousness. Idk, maybe...

---

## The Path Forward

The same patterns that govern prison dynamics may explain market behavior, organizational structure, and technological evolution. Currently, all I can say for certain is that these aren't abstract theories, at minimum, they're practical tools you can use today validated through:

- Building teams that naturally optimize
- Creating frameworks used by thousands
- Predicting market disruptions before they manifest
- Changing high-entropy systems into functional operations

*The principles work because they incorporate observed patterns from lived experience.* They include **consciousness**, **position**, and **intent** as essential features rather than inconvenient complications. This aligns closer with my lived experience and the patterns I've observed, but that isn't science, that's just my opinion. This needs to be validated through empirical research and validated by others. Maybe even you...

---

## Your Journey Begins

Whether you're optimizing a team of five or changing a system of millions, the same principles seem to apply. The operations appear to remain constant. Only scale and complexity seem to change.

Start by understanding where you areâ€”your position, your entropy, your available operations. Then apply the principles systematically:

1. **See the entropy** in your systems
2. **Identify the boundaries** that need transformation
3. **Calculate your position** and its constraints
4. **Measure the gaps** between intention and reality
5. **Work toward equilibrium** that serves your purpose

The universe tends toward entropy. We evolved to consciously choose its direction. These principles show how.

## The Meaning of Humanity

The meaning of humanity is you can choose your relationship to the chaos of the universeâ€”create or destroy, order or disorderâ€”but whatever you decide, you get to do it in your own way, and that's a beautiful thing. - *Kurtis Kemple*

## Final Thoughts

Information Physics suggests that from our observer-dependent position, we can't always know who is capable of great things and we've built system after system that makes it increasingly difficult to know.

*Arriving here feels inevitable and impossible at the same time.*
