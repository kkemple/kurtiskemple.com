Some discoveries begin in laboratories. Others emerge in offices, libraries, or lecture halls. But a few come from lived experience so intense that patterns become impossible to ignore. This is the story of how navigating humanity‚Äôs highest-entropy systems may have revealed universal principles that govern conscious organization ‚Äî from neural pathways to civilizations.

Right now I could be the world‚Äôs most high-functioning delusional, a pattern-matching machine who landed on a nine-word sentence so generally applicable it would make the Home Goods design team jealous, or I may have inadvertently discovered a new way to describe our place in the universe. I‚Äôll let you decide‚Äî*all I ask is that you keep an open mind until you've tested the theory for yourself.*

However, one thing I do know about myself is that I'm a practitioner-theorist. Growing up without a formal education or strong parental guidance‚Äî*though my mother was doing the best she could given her position in the universe, love you Mom! üíú*‚Äîforced me to be resourceful and develop my own solutions to navigate the systems I found myself in.

I build and test in the mud for sure, but I also like to step back and examine *why* things are the way they are. When you're consistently met with stark contradictions of what's written on paper vs the reality of the system:

- What people think of prison and formerly incarcerated people vs my lived experience.
- The difference between building software for developers vs consuming software built by developers.
- My reality as IC vs leadership‚Äîin both Software Engineering and Developer Relations.

**I'm consistently forced to reconcile these dual realities.**

Einstein realized on a train that physics depends on your reference frame. Nash discovered that optimal strategies depend on what others are doing by studying actual games. Both understood that the observer's position and context directly change the mathematics. This same principle applies to understanding human systems‚Äî*your perspective shapes what you can see and measure.*

To that point, I ask you, the reader, to do two things:

1. Be open to seeing the world through my experience and with the idea that lived experience is the most important source of information. That even Einstein and Nash would have been wrong if they had not considered their lived experience.
2. Be objective and scientifically rigorous in your approach, but leave classical academia at the door. I don't have a PhD, I'm not a professor, and I'm not a scientist‚Äînor do I have access to the same resources as a traditional academic establishment. I urge you to judge the theory on its own merits, not on the basis of traditional academic standards.

Okay, have we set the right stage? Are you ready to dive in? I'll leave you here to go the rest of the way on your own so you can form your own conclusions. *Just make sure they're your conclusions based in scientific method.*

## Living in Maximum Entropy

My earliest memories involve navigating complex systems where the official rules had little relation to actual dynamics. Family court, social services, friends in foster care‚Äîthese were my first lessons in how information really flows versus how it's supposed to flow. By age eight, I'd moved for the first time. By twenty, it was fourteen times across diverse neighborhoods and populations.

Three separate juvenile detention facilities. Two mental institutions. The welfare system. Each system had official structures, documented processes, and stated goals. None of them worked as advertised. The real information‚Äîwho had power, how decisions got made, what actually helped‚Äîflowed through hidden channels that you could only see from inside.

Then came prison. Six years in maximum-entropy environments where artificial chaos was maintained as a control mechanism. This wasn't accidental disorder‚Äîit was engineered entropy, deliberately preserved to prevent exactly what I started doing: optimizing information flow to reduce conflicts and create stability.

When you apply positive-sum optimization in a system designed for zero-sum chaos, the results are dramatic. The yard became calmer. Conflicts decreased. Information flowed more efficiently. And that's when I learned the most important lesson: **calm is more dangerous to control systems than chaos**. My systematic entropy reduction was so threatening to institutional power that it required intervention‚Äîimmediate transfer to disrupt the emerging order.

*This dramatic shift from chaos to order may follow patterns described by chaos theory‚Äîwhere small changes can create bifurcations and fundamentally different system behaviors. See [Chaos Theory and Conservation of Boundaries](/information-physics/conservation-of-boundaries#chaos-theory-and-conservation-of-boundaries-a-mathematical-bridge).*

---

## The Pattern Recognition Begins

After prison came community college, then corporate America. The transition from maximum to minimum entropy environments should have been jarring‚Äîdon't get me wrong, it was in certain ways like rewiring my brain to see myself as all these new identities. Instead, it revealed something important: the same patterns appeared everywhere, just at different intensities.

In software engineering, I moved from individual contributor to leadership, then repeated the cycle in developer relations. Each transition provided new vantage points‚Äîwhat organizational researchers call "parallax." The same system looks completely different from different positions, yet the underlying patterns remain constant.

My role in DevRel proved crucial. Speaking with thousands of developers from all kinds of organizations about how their systems actually work, helping them identify friction and optimize flow‚ÄîI was doing entropy engineering without naming it. Each conversation added another data point to an emerging pattern that spanned every type of organization as I sought to find the underlying friction and bottlenecks that were preventing them from being successful.

---

## A Rough Timeline of Events

Over the years, specific patterns crystallized into frameworks. They worked universally, but I didn't understand why, I attributed it to my first principles and systems thinking. My time growing up and my experience in prison instilled a need to do whatever I could to ensure others had access to more opportunity and resourse than I had. It generally manifested in me reverse engineering the things I was doing that yielded positive results so that I could develop a shared language for what I was doing intuitively and then provide practical tools built on that foundation for others to use. *Turns out I may have been onto something.*

### The Pyramid of Challenge (2017)

Building an engineering team at Major League Soccer, I needed to distribute challenge appropriately across all levels. The framework that emerged‚Äîhigh complexity/low availability at the top, low complexity/high availability at the base‚Äîworked perfectly. Only later did I realize this was [information density optimization in action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)). Teams thrived when challenge matched capacity, creating natural information flow from complex strategic decisions to distributed tactical execution.

### Dev Advocate's Guides Series (2020-2022)

At Apollo GraphQL‚Äî*and later during my DevRel consulting time*‚ÄîI developed a number of frameworks around common processes/problems that I was seeing across organizations. The Developer Advocate's guides series that emerged became some of the most popular content I've written and are still referenced regularly today.

### Keystone Paradox and Lava Leadership (2024)

Two frameworks emerged that brought me closer to understanding it was all about information flow. The Keystone Paradox identified how essential individuals become organizational bottlenecks‚Äîtheir irreplaceability creating information flow constraints. Lava Leadership showed how strategic thinking could bubble up from any position, like magma finding paths through rock. Both frameworks were about optimizing information movement through human systems. Several more frameworks emerged leading up to the discovery of Information Physics.

## The Cascade of Discovery

Once I realized there was a pattern, the discoveries came not as isolated insights but as an accelerating cascade‚Äîeach discovery revealing the next, until the complete architecture of Information Physics emerged in just six intense weeks.

### May 2025 - The First Glimpse

The journey to Information Physics began with a question: what made my frameworks work so well and so universally? How was I able to create them and find success in complex systems from prison to corporate America?

The first manifestation of **Conservation of Boundaries (COB)** emerged while reverse-engineering a recovery device solution. I'd inadvertently discovered that all my biggest impacts came from moving or transforming boundaries to reduce friction. But it was incomplete, *lacking the WHY.* When I shared it, I received valid feedback‚Äîit felt categorical to attribute values like *"resistance"* and *"quality"* to systems without deeper explanation.

> **My first Discord message captured the moment:** "Kurt Kemple ‚Äî 5/28/25, 12:11AM while trying to reverse engineer how I was able to solve the recovery problem, i may have inadvertently discovered a pattern for quantifying architectural innovation success (non-discovery, non-mechanical, etc) please help me disprove so I can go to sleep üò≠"

The realization of COB's symmetry‚Äîthat the same operations that build also destroy‚Äîmade me physically ill. The first version of what would become **Entropic Mathematics (EM)** was also born: `Actual Impact = (Operations √ó Quality) / (1 + Resistance)`, but without **Information Physics (IP)** or proper mathematical grounding, I tabled it as potential overreach in pattern matching.

*Only later, when discovering related sciences, did the pieces click‚Äîshared intent and AI work revealed `Quality` as vector `V`, Shannon and Landauer showed `Resistance` as entropy `E`, and my research into historic innovations solidified `Operations` as the boundary operations that enable entropy organization. The pattern was there‚ÄîI just needed the mathematical language to see it.*

### June 2025 - The Alarm Bell

A presentation about [NPS (net promoter score)](https://www.bain.com/consulting-services/customer-strategy-and-marketing/net-promoter-score-system/) and changing user bases triggered the next insight. When someone asked if we were seeing a similar decrease in [MAU (monthly active users)](https://www.paddle.com/resources/monthly-active-users), alarm bells rang. This didn't match my experience working daily with developers sharing their lived reality. Sometimes people have to use tools that don't align with their current needs to get the job done in an efficient way. This can happen for a multitude of reasons, but one thing is for certain, you can't dismiss the lived experience of the people using the tool, no matter what the metrics say.

**The reason became clear:** the separation of usage from lived-experience‚Äî*creating a boundary between those two realities*‚Äîcreated entropy for anyone downstream of that decision. From my position in the system, I could see what others couldn't‚Äî*that the math we rely on certainly has a way of removing us from the equation.*

**Frustration Coalitions (FC)** and then **Sentiment-Inertia Index (Sii)** emerged just four days after that meeting‚ÄîI dove into a significant amount of research to validate the patterns I was seeing‚Äîfirst for Slack, then I started looking into the broader B2B SaaS market. The validation was immediate‚Äîour research team at Slack confirmed the patterns, and a YC founder emailed about a seperate issue and specifically called out that they loved [my blog post](/blog/frustration-coalitions-the-hidden-threat-to-b2b-saas) and that it described the strategy they were using to out manuever a dominant B2B SaaS incumbent. The framework wasn't just theoretical; practitioners were already applying it intuitively. *Receiving such immediate validation was honestly jarring.*

During the creation of FCs, I discovered [Coalition Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Theory_of_Political_Coalitions) and saw striking resemblance to the six-stage framework I'd been developing for FCs. This led to [Network theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_theory), [Complexity science](https://www.santafe.edu/), [Percolation theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percolation_theory), and finally [Information theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory)‚Äîeach new field confirming patterns I'd observed independently.

### July 2025 - The Acceleration

Once I started exploring related sciences, connections accelerated exponentially. When I connected **Entropic Mathematics** to a potential causal mechanism behind Nash Equilibrium‚Äî*defining it as entropic exhaustion where every actor has optimized from their embedded position until further improvement becomes impossible*‚ÄîI became sure that I was onto something. This wasn't likely to be delusion or pattern matching‚Äîit appeared to be a legitimate discovery of potentially foundational principles, but given my lack of formal education, I was still skeptical.

Over ~~six weeks~~ (*now closer to 11 weeks*), **Information Physics**, **Entropic Mathematics**, and **Conservation of Boundaries** evolved from rough insights to foundational theory. Each discovery validated and extended the others, creating an internally consistent framework that explained phenomena across all scales.

> **This brings us to the present (August 7, 2025), or at least close to it üòÖ.** *I have carried this theory about as far I as I can go on my own. You could say I've even hit my own [entropic exhaustion](/information-physics/entropic-mathematics#nash-equilibrium-as-entropic-exhaustion)‚Äî`ŒîSEC/ŒîO ‚âà 0`‚Äîmaking any further progress impossible. I ask you the reader to help me carry it forward. Please, test the theory, build on it, against it, and with it. Let's see if we can [answer this question together](#the-complete-picture).*

## Information Physics Emerges

**Information Physics** explores the observation that organized systems appear to operate under two conditions: entropic constraint (requiring energy to maintain order) and systemic boundaries (existing within defined limits). Conscious beings may have evolved to navigate these apparent constraints using time and information as primary tools.

The key insight came from recognizing what might be a universal pattern:

1. Systems from quarks to civilizations seem to face similar dual constraints
2. Consciousness may represent a mechanism for navigating rather than merely obeying these constraints
3. Time and information‚Äîunlike matter and energy‚Äîpossibly operate under different principles

When I started looking at the patterns I was seeing across organizations through the lens of **Information Physics**, I realized that they were all related to three core challenges:

1. **Creating signal** from noise (information flow)
2. **Creating clarity** from system boundary complexity (workflow optimization through boundary operations‚ÄîConway's Law, Dunbar's Law, Domain Driven Design)
3. **Enabling entropy engineering** (swarming behaviors to reduce system entropy‚Äîincident response, customer triage, marketing opportunities, stock market trading, etc)

**The patterns clicked.** The frameworks I'd created, the systems I'd optimized, the patterns I'd recognized‚Äî*they appeared to address these three core challenges.*

Once I saw it throughout the digital age, I wondered if it extended further back. Investigating innovations like calendars and pyramids, watching my theory pass [Occam's Razor](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/simplicity/) test after test, I became nauseous again‚Äîthis time from the implications. Then I started exploring relationships to **science** as well.

The connection to physics might not be metaphorical, either. [Ginestra Bianconi's](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/maths/profiles/bianconig.html) work on [quantum relative entropy](https://journals.aps.org/prd/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevD.111.066001) suggests gravity itself might be an information phenomenon. [Claude Shannon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon) established the mathematical equivalence between information entropy and thermodynamic entropy. The patterns weren't similar to physics‚Äîthey potentially *were* physics applied to information systems.

Traditional mathematics abstracts away the observer to describe what happens in the universe when no one interferes‚Äîuniversal equations that work regardless of who's looking. `2+2=4` any way you look at it, an apple falls from a tree because of gravity. **Information Physics** expresses mathematics that account for the existence of conscious beings who can *choose* to change the universe, not just observe it. *What happens when someone sees that apple fall and discovers gravity itself? How does mathematics account for that?*

Heat affects cognition. Fatigue reduces decision quality. Stress limits perspective. Resource constraints shape choices. *The observer can't be removed from these calculations because consciousness exists in physics.* The same observer-dependence found in relativity and quantum mechanics appears to apply to human systems.

We may have evolved not just to survive entropy, but to navigate it‚Äîusing time and information to chart paths through constraint. From neural pathways to social systems, our behavior reflects this core function. Information Physics is a mathematical framework for conscious agents embedded in entropic reality‚Äîdesigned to model how we perceive constraints, process information, and act over time.

> **The nine word sentence that forms the entire axiom of Information Physics:**
>
> *"All organized systems are entropically constrained and systemically bounded."*

---

## The Complete Picture

These three discoveries form a theoretical framework:

1. **Information Physics**: A proposed theory exploring how embedded agents navigate conditions of entropic constraint and systemic boundaries using time and information. These agents may be able to influence entropy through observer-dependent operations.
2. **Conservation of Boundaries**: The observation that within bounded reality, transformation seems to occur through three operations: **MOVE**, **JOIN**, or **SEPARATE**. These appear to represent the complete set of transformations available within geometric and informational constraints.
3. **Entropic Mathematics**: Proposed mathematical framework for conscious systems where position may determine possibility. The framework attempts to capture how agents navigate entropic constraints from their specific location, with calculations potentially reflecting thermodynamic costs.

Together, they may explain patterns across every scale of human organization‚Äîfrom neural pathways to global civilizations.

Whether you're optimizing a team of five or changing a system of millions, the same principles seem to apply. The operations appear to remain constant, and only scale and complexity seem to change.

**Welcome to Information Physics.**

### Core Framework

These three foundational components form the complete theoretical architecture of Information Physics. Together they provide a mathematical language for describing how conscious beings interact with entropy through position-dependent operations. Each builds upon the others to create an internally consistent framework that may explain patterns across all scales of human organization.
