Take any problem that seems permanent—any situation where you feel trapped within boundaries facing overwhelming constraints. These aren't unique failures but universal conditions: all organized systems are entropically constrained and systemically bounded.

The difference between "stuck" and "navigating" lies in how effectively you use time and information to work around constraints. Information Physics provides the mathematics to calculate exactly which navigation tools are available from your position and how to use them.

## The Test Protocol

Feed an LLM your *just how it is* problem with the [IP Study Guide](/information-physics-study-guide.txt) and [The Peasant](/the-peasant.txt) (playbook for positive-sum entropy engineering) doc.

### The Process

Ask the LLM to review the IP Study Guide and The Peasant doc and ask you questions to figure out your E, V, and `O` variables. Then ask it to calculate your `SEC` value and provide a list of operations you can execute to navigate your constraints.

This will help ensure you can follow this process:

1. **Map your boundaries:** What systemic limits constrain you? (Rules, resources, relationships)
2. **Calculate entropic burden `(E)`:** How much energy do you burn just maintaining position?
3. **Identify navigation tools:** What time horizons can you plan? What information can you access?
4. **Determine shared intent `(V)`:** What outcome enables collective navigation?
5. **Map available operations:** Which boundary transformations (`MOVE`, `JOIN`, `SEPARATE`) can you afford?
6. **Calculate current `SEC = O × V / (1 + E)`**
7. **Design navigation strategy:** How can you use time and information to work around constraints?
8. **Compare to traditional approaches:** Which actually reduces constraints vs managing symptoms?

The comparison may reveal which framework enables navigation versus which assumes you'll remain stuck.

## Your Starting Point

Information Physics begins with honest assessment of where you actually stand.

> `SEC = O × V / (1 + E)`

> Where: **O** = Operations cost (MOVE=1, JOIN=2, SEPARATE=3) | **V** = Vector of conscious intent (-1 to +1) | **E** = Positional entropy (0 to ∞)

### Position Reality Check

Calculate your `E` based on actual constraints, not wishful thinking.

`E = Σ(entropy sources) / available_info`

- **Low E (0.1-0.3):** Strategic decisions possible, resources available, broad visibility
- **Medium E (0.4-0.6):** Some autonomy exists, translation work required, moderate friction
- **High E (0.7-0.9):** Following others' decisions, minimal resources, maximum constraints

Accepting your real position enables selecting operations that actually work.

### What You Actually Want

`V` represents shared conscious intent for the system's purpose.

- **V = +1:** "We want this outcome" (successful project, thriving team, solved problem)
- **V = 0:** "We have no shared vision of success"
- **V = -1:** "We're actively working against this outcome"

Clarity about desired outcome shapes which operations make sense.

### Operations Available to You

From your specific position, which boundary transformations `(O)` can you execute? (i.e. `MOVE`, `JOIN`, `SEPARATE`)

- **MOVE:** Relocate information, resources, or connections to reduce friction
- **JOIN:** Unite elements that naturally work better together
- **SEPARATE:** Break apart forced coupling that creates waste

**Why operation values matter (MOVE=1, JOIN=2, SEPARATE=3):**
These values reflect actual thermodynamic energy costs. MOVE requires the least energy (just repositioning), JOIN requires moderate energy (creating new connections), and SEPARATE requires the most energy (breaking bonds and maintaining separation). This hierarchy explains why reorganization is often easier than restructuring.

Match operations to your actual capability, not theoretical possibilities.

## Working Through Problems

Apply Information Physics to common "unchangeable" situations.

### "Our Meetings Are Useless But Required"

Everyone complains about wasteful meetings, but they persist because traditional solutions address symptoms rather than entropy sources.

- **IP approach:** Calculate meeting `E` (confusion, time waste). Identify `V` (+1 = productive collaboration). Design `MOVE` operations (async updates), `JOIN` operations (combine related meetings), `SEPARATE` operations (decouple status from strategy).
- **Traditional approaches:** More agenda items, better facilitation, meeting-free days
- **Compare:** Which reduces actual entropy from your position?

The Information Physics approach suggests that meeting dysfunction stems from misaligned information flows, not poor facilitation skills.

### "The Hiring Process Takes Forever"

Hiring delays frustrate everyone involved, yet speed-up initiatives often make the problem worse by adding more steps and approvals.

- **IP approach:** Map `E` at each stage. Find where `V` breaks down (who doesn't want speed?). Apply operations: `MOVE` decisions closer to teams, `JOIN` separated approval steps, `SEPARATE` must-haves from nice-to-haves.
- **Traditional approaches:** Hire more recruiters, buy ATS software, create urgency.
- **Compare:** Which addresses root entropy versus symptoms?

By targeting the entropy created by decision distance and approval fragmentation, IP reduces hiring time without sacrificing quality.

### "Nobody Uses Our Documentation"

Documentation that nobody reads represents massive wasted effort, yet most solutions focus on making people use bad docs rather than making docs worth using.

- **IP approach:** Calculate user `E` when finding information. Check if `V` aligns (do creators want it used?). Operations: `MOVE` docs to where work happens, `JOIN` related content, `SEPARATE` reference from learning.
- **Traditional approaches:** Mandate documentation reviews, gamify contributions, better search
- **Compare:** Which reduces friction versus adding process?

Information Physics suggests that unused documentation fails because it increases rather than decreases entropy for the people who need the information.

Each comparison suggests how Information Physics may target entropy sources rather than symptoms.

## Measuring What Works

Track progress using Entropic Gap between current and desired states.

`EG = 1 - S(current_state, target_state)`

- **EG < 0.10:** Solution working as intended
- **0.10-0.25:** Needs adjustment but improving
- **0.25-0.45:** Significant drift from goal
- **> 0.45:** Approach isn't reducing entropy

Traditional metrics often hide entropy accumulation. EG may reveal it.

---

## The Comparison Framework

Test Information Physics against any existing solution framework.

**Questions for comparison:**

- Which identifies your actual position constraints?
- Which clarifies shared intent versus assumed agreement?
- Which provides operations you can actually execute?
- Which shows measurable entropy reduction?
- Which works from high-E positions?

The mathematics doesn't argue superiority. Results demonstrate effectiveness.

## Why This May Change Everything

Traditional frameworks ignore the fundamental reality: all systems are entropically constrained and systemically bounded. They assume everyone has equal ability to navigate these conditions. Information Physics recognizes that a janitor and CEO have vastly different navigation tools—different time horizons for planning, different information access for understanding.

Most solutions fail because they're designed by people with extensive navigation capability (time to strategize, information to coordinate) for people whose navigation tools are limited or denied. They create solutions requiring time and information that high-E positions don't have.

Information Physics starts with the universal conditions everyone faces, then calculates which navigation strategies actually work from your specific position. It transforms **"just how it is"** from resignation to recognition—you're not uniquely failing, you're navigating the same constraints all organized systems face.

The difference is knowing how to use whatever time and information you have to work around boundaries rather than beating against them.

**Recognize constraints. Map boundaries. Navigate intelligently.**
