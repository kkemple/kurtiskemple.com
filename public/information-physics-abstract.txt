# Information Physics: A Position-Dependent Framework for Conscious System Dynamics

## Abstract

Information Physics proposes a unifying theoretical and mathematical framework describing how conscious agents embedded in entropy modify system trajectories through observer-dependent operations. Following the lineage of Einstein's relativity (physics depends on reference frame) and Nash's game theory (optimal strategies depend on others' actions), this framework treats consciousness, position, and lived experience as fundamental mathematical variables. The theory defines three irreducible operations—`MOVE`, `JOIN`, and `SEPARATE`—as the only mechanisms by which boundaries (informational, organizational, spatial, cognitive) transform. The operation values (MOVE=1, JOIN=2, SEPARATE=3) reflect actual thermodynamic energy hierarchy, grounding the framework in physical law. These operations interact with an agent's positional entropy `(E)`, directional intent `(V)`, and operational capacity `(O)` to generate measurable effects on system entropy, captured by the core equation:

```math
SEC = \frac{O \times V}{1 + E}
```

Building on the established equivalence between Shannon information entropy and thermodynamic entropy, the theory extends these foundations to explain cognitive and social dynamics, organizational change, innovation cycles, and large-scale civilizational evolution. Conscious Chaos, a recent theoretical extension, introduces time-sensitivity and perturbation dynamics into the model via:

```math
\frac{dSEC}{dt} = O \times V \times f(E) \times [1 + \alpha \cdot \sin(\omega t)]
```

This evolution function allows entropy trajectory modeling under stress, fatigue, or emergent alignment, integrating concepts from chaos theory, percolation thresholds, and attractor basins. Here `f(E) = 1/(1+E)` represents the entropy dampening function.

The theory accounts for:

* Nash Equilibrium as entropic exhaustion (`ΔSEC/ΔO ≈ 0`)
* Mass extinction patterns (SEC generalist > specialist)
* Organizational collapse and crowd behavior (percolation + high-E systems)
* Innovation density (entropy explains historical disparities)
* Real energetic cost of cognition and decision-making (Landauer's principle + E)

Information Physics introduces a minimal viable modeling system using `E`, `V`, `O`, `α`, and `ω` to simulate conscious systems constrained by entropy. Its explanatory power spans neural networks, economic behavior, agent-based modeling, and planetary survivability.

This framework may provide the first cross-scale, observer-embedded mathematical theory of conscious systems embedded in entropy.

While theoretical predictions align with observed patterns across multiple domains, systematic empirical validation remains necessary to establish the framework's validity.
