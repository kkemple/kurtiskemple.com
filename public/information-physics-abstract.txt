# Information Physics: A Position-Dependent Framework for Conscious System Dynamics

## Abstract

Information Physics proposes a unifying theoretical and mathematical framework describing how conscious agents embedded in entropy modify system trajectories through observer-dependent operations. The theory defines three irreducible operations—`MOVE`, `JOIN`, and `SEPARATE`—as the only mechanisms by which boundaries (informational, organizational, spatial, cognitive) transform. These operations interact with an agent's positional entropy (`E`), directional intent (`V`), and operational capacity (`O`) to generate measurable effects on system entropy, captured by the core equation:

```math
SEC = \frac{O \times V}{1 + E}
```

Building on the established equivalence between Shannon information entropy and thermodynamic entropy, the theory extends these foundations to explain cognitive and social dynamics, organizational change, innovation cycles, and large-scale civilizational evolution. Conscious Chaos, a recent theoretical extension, introduces time-sensitivity and perturbation dynamics into the model via:

```math
\frac{dSEC}{dt} = O \times V \times f(E) \times [1 + \alpha \cdot \sin(\omega t)]
```

This evolution function allows entropy trajectory modeling under stress, fatigue, or emergent alignment, integrating concepts from chaos theory, percolation thresholds, and attractor basins.

The theory accounts for:

* Nash Equilibrium as entropic exhaustion (`ΔSEC/ΔO ≈ 0`)
* Mass extinction patterns (SEC generalist > specialist)
* Organizational collapse and crowd behavior (percolation + high-E systems)
* Innovation density (entropy explains historical disparities)
* Real energetic cost of cognition and decision-making (Landauer's principle + E)

Information Physics introduces a minimal viable modeling system using `E`, `V`, `O`, `α`, and `ω` to simulate conscious systems under thermodynamic constraint. Its explanatory power spans neural networks, economic behavior, agent-based modeling, and planetary survivability.

This framework may provide the first cross-scale, observer-embedded mathematical theory for understanding how physical consciousness interacts with entropy—not passively, but transformatively.
