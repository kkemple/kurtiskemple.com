## Created Frameworks

### Business & Market Analysis

**Frustration Coalitions**
Six-stage process where frustrated users organize for mass defection. Accelerated by PLG from months to weeks.
- Key metric: Sentiment-Inertia Index (Sii = (100-NPS)/Churn)
- Critical threshold: Sii > 170 indicates imminent exodus
- Blog: /blog/frustration-coalitions

**Friction Economy**
Hidden force where 75% of B2B SaaS maintains retention despite declining satisfaction.
- Systematic UX failures create disruption opportunities
- Captive users become exodus events when alternatives emerge
- Blog: /blog/friction-economy

**Keystone Paradox**
When essential employees become organizational liabilities through knowledge hoarding.
- Identification: Single points of failure in critical processes
- Solution: Systematic knowledge distribution
- Blog: /blog/keystone-paradox

**Prime Band Routing**
Mathematical approach to eliminating database hotspots using prime numbers and golden ratio patterns.
- Reduces shard fan-out by 85%
- Improves query latency and system predictability
- Blog: /blog/prime-band-routing

### Developer Relations

**DX Audits v2**
Systematic approach to developer experience improvement.
- Four phases: Discover, Build, Report, Follow Up
- Creates structured feedback loops
- Blog: /blog/developer-advocates-guide-to-addressing-product-friction

**Developer Relations Value Cycle**
Engagement → Impact → Enablement measurement framework.
- Distinguishes trusted vs vanity metrics
- Connects DevRel to business outcomes
- Blog: /blog/developer-advocates-guide-to-metrics-and-reporting

**YAP Model (Yet Another Program)**
Identifies when program management overhead exceeds value creation.
- Solution: Separate management from participation
- Blog: /blog/explaining-the-yap-model

**Pyramid of Challenge**
Framework for appropriate team member engagement.
- Balances complexity vs availability
- Prevents under/over-challenging
- Blog: /blog/pyramid-of-challenge

## About Kurt's Journey

Learned to code while incarcerated, leading to complete life transformation. This unconventional path shaped approach to technology—finding opportunities where conventional thinking ends. Now applies pattern recognition across domains from quantum mechanics to organizational dynamics, discovering universal principles governing all organized systems.

Currently: Building Platform DX & AI infrastructure at Slack while pursuing personal projects in science and mathematics. Living proof that constraints create innovation opportunities.

Core belief: The best opportunities exist at the intersection of deep technical understanding and human empathy, where systematic thinking meets practical application grounded in the experience of others.
