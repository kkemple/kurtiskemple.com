# Kurt Kemple's Website

## About

This is the personal website of Kurt Kemple, Senior Director of Developer Relations at Slack. Kurt's journey to tech leadership began in the most unexpected place: learning to code while incarcerated. That unconventional start shaped his entire approach to technology and his belief that the best opportunities often exist where conventional thinking ends.

Kurt specializes in finding the intersection between developer needs and business outcomes, whether that's building AI-enabled tools that deliver 10x productivity gains, creating measurement frameworks that connect DevRel to revenue, or identifying market dynamics before they materialize. He's the creator of frameworks and theories like DX Audits, Developer Relations Value Cycle, Frustration Coalitions, Keystone Paradox, Lava Leadership, LLM Experience (LX), Leaky Prompts, Information Physics, and more that help individuals and companies identify, name, and dismantle complexity.

His theoretical work on Information Physics provides the foundational understanding of why his practical frameworks consistently work across different domains - revealing that humans organize information systems using patterns they understand from physics, leading to consistent optimization approaches across cultures and contexts.

His work focuses on making the invisible work of developer relations visible and measurable, connecting systematic approaches to developer experience with clear business impact. Kurt's writing combines strategic thinking with actionable frameworks, drawing from his experience in DevRel, product management, and engineering leadership. His blog covers everything from day-to-day DevRel operations to high-level competitive strategy and organizational psychology.

Currently writing a book on strategic DevRel for Apress, Kurt writes, speaks, and advises on developer relations strategy, competitive market analysis, and building exceptional developer experiences. His perspective is shaped by resilience, systems thinking, and a commitment to democratizing technology access.

When not dissecting market dynamics or building developer communities, you'll find him exploring the world through street photography, riding his motorcycle, or going on adventures with his wife and two kids.

### Foundational Theory

**[Information Physics Theory: How Human Systems Exhibit Physics-Like Patterns](https://kurtiskemple.com/blog/information-physics)**
*Framework: Information Physics - The Universal Principle of Human System Design*

- **Intent**: Establish the foundational theory explaining why humans across all cultures and time periods consistently create similar optimization patterns in information systems
- **Core Definition**: Information Physics: Theory proposing that humans evolved to observe and resist entropy, manifesting as consistent optimization patterns across all scales of human organization
- **Core Principle**: Humans are "entropy-competent beings" - evolved to observe entropy, model it, and build against it. All complex systems are bound by entropy; what makes humans unique is our ability to see that constraint and architect against it.
- **Universal Connection**: Links to cutting-edge physics research (Ginestra Bianconi's quantum relative entropy theory) suggesting the same information-theoretic principles governing fundamental physics also govern human civilization
- **Universal Pattern**: Structure emerges from entropy pressure across all scales - from neural pathways to civilizations. Information wants to flow, and humans consistently organize systems to optimize that flow using physics-like principles.
- **Historical Evidence**: Convergent evolution across isolated civilizations proves these aren't cultural patterns but universal optimization principles:
  - Calendar systems (information pyramids: Year → Seasons → Days)
  - Pyramid architecture (information compression and broadcast systems)
  - Language evolution (40 phonemes, Zipf's Law, universal speech rate of ~39 bits/second)
  - Writing systems (pictographic → linear optimization)
  - Currency evolution (commodity → digital, reducing information friction)
- **Biological Foundation**: The human brain is the original information physics engine - evolved for recursive optimization through:
  - Hebbian plasticity (neurons that fire together wire together)
  - Synaptic pruning (removing unused connections)
  - Myelination (insulating high-traffic circuits)
  - Bilateral optimization (left hemisphere pattern recognition + right hemisphere pattern application)
- **Modern Applications**: Digital systems reveal pure information dynamics without physical constraints, following the same optimization patterns
- **Measurable Principles**: These aren't metaphors but actual information theory principles with predictive power:
  - Shannon entropy in organizational communication
  - Percolation thresholds in network formation
  - Metcalfe's Law in platform economics
  - Dunbar's number in team design
  - Power laws in resource distribution
  - Information velocity as competitive advantage
  - Nash Equilibrium as Information Convergence: Reframes equilibrium from mathematical condition to information physics process - convergence of every actor taking optimal action from their observer-dependent position until system reaches stable information flow configuration
- **Success vs Failure Patterns**:
  - Success: Work WITH information patterns (compression algorithms, parallel processing, quantum computing)
  - Failure: Violate fundamental constraints (infinite growth economics, perpetual engagement platforms, 24/7 systems)
- **Artificial Entropy Maintenance**: Explains apparent violations of Information Physics - some systems deliberately maintain entropy as control mechanisms, fighting against natural optimization tendencies. This requires unsustainable energy expenditure that leads to inevitable collapse (Rome, Soviet Union, etc.). The thermodynamic reality is inescapable: systems fighting Information Physics are borrowing energy from their future stability.
- **The Captive Population Pattern**: Reveals universal control mechanism across B2B SaaS (captive users), political systems (captive citizens), and correctional systems (captive inmates) - all use artificial exit barriers + managed internal entropy to prevent collective systemic analysis. When captive populations stop fighting each other, they begin examining the system itself, which threatens institutional control.
- **Real-World Validation**: Theory validated through direct experience optimizing a prison population, where systematic entropy reduction became so threatening to institutional control it required intervention. The calm was more dangerous to power structures than chaos because it enabled collective systemic analysis - proving artificial entropy is a deliberate control mechanism.
- **Specialized Human Functions**: Some individuals develop as "entropy specialists" - system-level entropy reducers who function like white blood cells in biological systems. They systematically identify, name, and dismantle complexity across domains through:
  - Cross-domain effectiveness (business analysis, competitive intelligence, marketing positioning)
  - Instinctive operation across organizational boundaries
  - Focus on "glue work" - invisible labor that holds information systems together
  - Often experience isolation due to their systemic perspective
- **Digital Native Shift**: Hierarchical thinkers (tree structures) vs graph-native thinkers (network structures) represent adaptation to different information topologies
- **Religion as Entropy Resistance**: Spiritual systems represent humanity's deepest resistance to entropy - offering continuity beyond decay (afterlife, reincarnation, eternal memory) while encoding and transmitting order through rituals, sacred texts, moral codes, and symbolic systems. Religion isn't separate from Information Physics; it's one of its oldest and most enduring applications as civilizational architecture built to resist collapse.
- **Climate Change as Physical Manifestation**: The principles connect directly to our biggest challenge - inefficient information systems don't just create abstract friction, they burn real energy and produce tangible waste. Climate change is the ultimate Entropic Gap: the measurable, physical distance between the clear, low-entropy information our planet's systems provide and the chaotic, high-entropy systems our civilization operates. It's the thermodynamic bill for centuries of running high-resistance information systems that fight against natural optimization laws.
- **Not Metaphor but Physics**: The most compelling validation isn't found in analogies but in collapse - human systems fail when they ignore information flow laws, just as perpetual motion machines fail by violating thermodynamic limits. Companies promising infinite growth deny cognitive load limits; platforms demanding constant engagement fight human processing constraints; economies assuming eternal acceleration ignore that even brains prune connections to remain efficient.
- **Impact**: This is THE foundational theory that explains why all of Kurt's frameworks work universally. Information Physics reveals the fundamental dynamics of power, control, and liberation in human systems. It's not that humans organize systems "like" physics - information organization IS physics, and humans evolved to be its natural expression. From neural pathways to market dynamics to climate change, it's all the same pattern: conscious beings recognizing entropy and building systems to resist it. Every other framework derives from and validates these underlying principles, even though most were developed prior to Information Physics.

**[The Conservation of Boundaries: Entropic Engineering for Human Systems](https://kurtiskemple.com/blog/conservation-of-boundaries)**
*Framework: Conservation of Boundaries (COB) - Universal System Transformation Theory*

- **Intent**: Map how all system evolution—innovation and collapse—follows predictable patterns of boundary manipulation as Information Physics in action
- **Core Definition**: The Conservation of Boundaries (COB) is the principle that all system evolution—whether innovation or collapse—follows transformations of boundaries through three irreducible operations: MOVE, JOIN, and SEPARATE, governed by entropy as entropic pressure on system transformation
- **Universal Formula**: SE = O × Q / (1 + E) where System Evolution equals Operations count times Quality direction divided by domain-specific entropy measurement plus one
- **Three Irreducible Operations** (direction-neutral primitives used for both construction and destruction):
  - **MOVE**: Shift existing boundaries to new positions/contexts while preserving essential structure (migration, re-platforming, decentralization)
  - **JOIN**: Combine previously separate elements into unified wholes, creating new capabilities through combination (alliances, integrations, unification movements)
  - **SEPARATE**: Divide unified systems into distinct parts, enabling focused optimization and independent evolution (spinouts, revolution, specialization)
- **The Entropic Field**: Entropy as entropic pressure that determines transformation difficulty - positive (inertia, fear, structural lock-in, institutional drag), zero (neutral, mechanical transformation), negative (pent-up demand, cultural readiness, systemic instability)
- **Domain Applications**: Same formula applies across B2B SaaS markets (using Sii), AI Systems (using EG), Human Cognition (using CG), Team Dynamics (using challenge gaps)
- **Entropic Inversion Symmetry**: Same operations explain both construction and collapse - MOVE becomes dislocation, JOIN becomes overconsolidation, SEPARATE becomes fragmentation. High quality operations in reverse (misinformation, propaganda, strategic sabotage) cause high-fidelity collapse through reverse entropic engineering
- **Predictive Intelligence**: Diagnostic questions transform COB from descriptive to strategic - "Where is entropy falling?" signals early disruption, "What operation is missing?" identifies stalled transformation
- **COB as Entropic Engineering**: Reveals that humans cannot create or destroy boundaries, only transform them through optimized flow paths to resist entropic collapse. All transformation is rearranging boundary conditions to enable information flow - calendars compress seasonal entropy, pyramids encode societal entropy, writing stores communication entropy, organizations delegate cognitive entropy
- **Impact**: COB is the practical application framework for Information Physics - the actionable map showing how entropy-competent beings systematically transform any human system through boundary manipulation. It's not a framework you use, it's the framework you're already using without naming it. COB works because human systems are information structures under entropy.

## Common Themes

Kurt's work is unified by Information Physics - the foundational principle that humans are entropy-competent beings who consistently organize information systems using physics-like optimization patterns. Every framework manifests this core understanding:

- **Information Physics as Universal Foundation**: All frameworks work because they align with how humans naturally optimize information flow - from neural pathways to civilizations, the same patterns emerge because we evolved to observe entropy and build against it
- **Entropy-Based System Analysis**: Success comes from working with information physics principles; failure comes from violating fundamental constraints. This explains why certain strategies work universally while others inevitably collapse
- **Measurable Information Theory**: Using actual physics principles (Shannon entropy, percolation thresholds, Metcalfe's Law, Dunbar's number) to predict and optimize human system performance
- **Pattern Recognition Across Scales**: The same optimization patterns appear from individual cognition → team dynamics → organizational structure → market behavior → civilizational development
- **Structure Emerges from Entropy Pressure**: Hierarchies, networks, workflows, and systems naturally optimize toward information flow efficiency - understanding this allows for better design and prediction
- **Cross-Functional Alignment Through Information Flow**: Teams succeed when they reduce information entropy through clear channels, shared terminology, and optimized communication pathways
- **Strategic Frameworks as Information Optimization**: Every practical framework (DX Audits, Frustration Coalitions, DAVC, etc.) succeeds because it reduces information friction and optimizes flow
- **Systematic Approaches to Complex Problems**: Transform traditionally intuitive work into measurable, repeatable processes by understanding underlying information dynamics
- **Competitive Advantage Through Information Velocity**: Organizations that optimize information processing speed and quality consistently outperform those that don't
- **Human-Centric Design**: Systems succeed when they align with biological information processing limits rather than fighting them
- **Practical Implementation of Grand Theory**: Information Physics isn't abstract theory - it provides concrete, measurable principles for improving everything from AI systems to organizational design

The central insight: Humans evolved to see entropy and fight it, so every successful human system—from neural networks to civilizations—is just physics principles made conscious and social.
