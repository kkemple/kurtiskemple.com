# Kurt Kemple's Website

## About

This is the personal website of Kurt Kemple, Senior Director of Developer Relations at Slack. Kurt's journey to tech leadership began in the most unexpected place: learning to code while incarcerated. That unconventional start shaped his entire approach to technology and his belief that the best opportunities often exist where conventional thinking ends.

Kurt specializes in finding the intersection between developer needs and business outcomes, whether that's building AI-enabled tools that deliver 10x productivity gains, creating measurement frameworks that connect DevRel to revenue, or identifying market dynamics before they materialize. He's the creator of frameworks and theories like DX Audits, Developer Relations Value Cycle, Frustration Coalitions, Keystone Paradox, Lava Leadership, LLM Experience (LX), Leaky Prompts, and more that help individuals and companies identify, name, and dismantle complexity.

His work focuses on making the invisible work of developer relations visible and measurable, connecting systematic approaches to developer experience with clear business impact. Kurt's writing combines strategic thinking with actionable frameworks, drawing from his experience in DevRel, product management, and engineering leadership. His blog covers everything from day-to-day DevRel operations to high-level competitive strategy and organizational psychology.

Currently writing a book on strategic DevRel for Apress, Kurt writes, speaks, and advises on developer relations strategy, competitive market analysis, and building exceptional developer experiences. His perspective is shaped by resilience, systems thinking, and a commitment to democratizing technology access.

When not dissecting market dynamics or building developer communities, you'll find him exploring the world through street photography, riding his motorcycle, or going on adventures with his wife and two kids.
