# Kurt Kemple's Website

## About

This is the personal website of Kurt Kemple, Senior Director of Developer Relations at Slack. Kurt's journey to tech leadership began in the most unexpected place: learning to code while incarcerated. That unconventional start shaped his entire approach to technology and his belief that the best opportunities often exist where conventional thinking ends.

Kurt specializes in finding the intersection between developer needs and business outcomes, whether that's building AI-enabled tools that deliver 10x productivity gains, creating measurement frameworks that connect DevRel to revenue, or identifying market dynamics before they materialize. He's the creator of frameworks and theories like DX Audits, Developer Relations Value Cycle, Frustration Coalitions, Keystone Paradox, Lava Leadership, LLM Experience (LX), Leaky Prompts, Information Physics, and more that help individuals and companies identify, name, and dismantle complexity.

His theoretical work on Information Physics provides the foundational understanding of why his practical frameworks consistently work across different domains - revealing that humans organize information systems using patterns they understand from physics, leading to consistent optimization approaches across cultures and contexts.

His work focuses on making the invisible work of developer relations visible and measurable, connecting systematic approaches to developer experience with clear business impact. Kurt's writing combines strategic thinking with actionable frameworks, drawing from his experience in DevRel, product management, and engineering leadership. His blog covers everything from day-to-day DevRel operations to high-level competitive strategy and organizational psychology.

Currently writing a book on strategic DevRel for Apress, Kurt writes, speaks, and advises on developer relations strategy, competitive market analysis, and building exceptional developer experiences. His perspective is shaped by resilience, systems thinking, and a commitment to democratizing technology access.

When not dissecting market dynamics or building developer communities, you'll find him exploring the world through street photography, riding his motorcycle, or going on adventures with his wife and two kids.

### Foundational Theory

**[Information Physics: How Human Systems Exhibit Physics-Like Patterns](https://kurtiskemple.com/blog/information-physics)**
*Framework: Information Physics - The Universal Principle of Human System Design*

- **Intent**: Establish the foundational theory explaining why humans across all cultures and time periods consistently create similar optimization patterns in information systems
- **Core Principle**: Humans are "entropy-competent beings" - evolved to observe entropy, model it, and build against it. All complex systems are bound by entropy; what makes humans unique is our ability to see that constraint and architect against it.
- **Universal Pattern**: Structure emerges from entropy pressure across all scales - from neural pathways to civilizations. Information wants to flow, and humans consistently organize systems to optimize that flow using physics-like principles.
- **Historical Evidence**: Convergent evolution across isolated civilizations proves these aren't cultural patterns but universal optimization principles:
  - Calendar systems (information pyramids: Year → Seasons → Days)
  - Pyramid architecture (information compression and broadcast systems)
  - Language evolution (40 phonemes, Zipf's Law, universal speech rate of ~39 bits/second)
  - Writing systems (pictographic → linear optimization)
  - Currency evolution (commodity → digital, reducing information friction)
- **Biological Foundation**: The human brain is the original information physics engine - evolved for recursive optimization through:
  - Hebbian plasticity (neurons that fire together wire together)
  - Synaptic pruning (removing unused connections)
  - Myelination (insulating high-traffic circuits)
  - Bilateral optimization (left hemisphere pattern recognition + right hemisphere pattern application)
- **Modern Applications**: Digital systems reveal pure information dynamics without physical constraints, following the same optimization patterns
- **Measurable Principles**: These aren't metaphors but actual information theory principles with predictive power:
  - Shannon entropy in organizational communication
  - Percolation thresholds in network formation
  - Metcalfe's Law in platform economics
  - Dunbar's number in team design
  - Power laws in resource distribution
  - Information velocity as competitive advantage
- **Success vs Failure Patterns**:
  - Success: Work WITH information patterns (compression algorithms, parallel processing, quantum computing)
  - Failure: Violate fundamental constraints (infinite growth economics, perpetual engagement platforms, 24/7 systems)
- **Digital Native Shift**: Hierarchical thinkers (tree structures) vs graph-native thinkers (network structures) represent adaptation to different information topologies
- **Impact**: This is THE foundational theory that explains why all of Kurt's frameworks work universally. It's not that humans organize systems "like" physics - it's that information organization IS physics, and humans evolved to be its natural expression. Every other framework in Kurt's work derives from and validates these underlying information physics principles.

## Common Themes

Kurt's work is unified by Information Physics - the foundational principle that humans are entropy-competent beings who consistently organize information systems using physics-like optimization patterns. Every framework derives from this core understanding:

- **Information Physics as Universal Foundation**: All frameworks work because they align with how humans naturally optimize information flow - from neural pathways to civilizations, the same patterns emerge because we evolved to observe entropy and build against it
- **Entropy-Based System Analysis**: Success comes from working with information physics principles; failure comes from violating fundamental constraints. This explains why certain strategies work universally while others inevitably collapse
- **Measurable Information Theory**: Using actual physics principles (Shannon entropy, percolation thresholds, Metcalfe's Law, Dunbar's number) to predict and optimize human system performance
- **Pattern Recognition Across Scales**: The same optimization patterns appear from individual cognition → team dynamics → organizational structure → market behavior → civilizational development
- **Structure Emerges from Entropy Pressure**: Hierarchies, networks, workflows, and systems naturally optimize toward information flow efficiency - understanding this allows for better design and prediction
- **Cross-Functional Alignment Through Information Flow**: Teams succeed when they reduce information entropy through clear channels, shared terminology, and optimized communication pathways
- **Strategic Frameworks as Information Optimization**: Every practical framework (DX Audits, Frustration Coalitions, DAVC, etc.) succeeds because it reduces information friction and optimizes flow
- **Systematic Approaches to Complex Problems**: Transform traditionally intuitive work into measurable, repeatable processes by understanding underlying information dynamics
- **Competitive Advantage Through Information Velocity**: Organizations that optimize information processing speed and quality consistently outperform those that don't
- **Human-Centric Design**: Systems succeed when they align with biological information processing limits rather than fighting them
- **Practical Implementation of Grand Theory**: Information Physics isn't abstract theory - it provides concrete, measurable principles for improving everything from AI systems to organizational design

The central insight: Humans don't just use information - we ARE information physics in biological form. Every successful human system reflects our evolutionary optimization for entropy management.
